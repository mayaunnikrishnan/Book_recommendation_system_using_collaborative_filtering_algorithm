The spelling is, in many cases,\\nstrange to modern standards and highly variable. I have noted a\\nsmall number of cases which would, I think, have been considered\\nabsurd by the original author. These have been amended to a more\\nconsonant form; all other spelling has been retained as the\\noriginal. Some apparently incorrect or missing punctuation has\\nbeen corrected. The reader should note that [~o] and [~e] have\\nbeen used to represent the vowel superscribed by a tilde mark.\\nThis implies nasalization and should be read as indicating an\\nomitted 'm' or 'n' following the vowel.

But\\nvnder one name both are comprised, as they are now mingled one\\nwith another and doe both together make vp one entire and round\\nbody. Neither doe wee diue into the bowels of the earth, and\\nenter into consideration of the naturall qualities, which are in\\nthe substance of Earth and water, as coldnes, drinesse moisture,\\nheauines, and the like, but wee looke only vpon the out side,\\ncontemplating the greatnesse, scituation, distances, measuringe,\\nand other such affections which appeare in the superficies of it,\\nto the eyes of our bodies and mindes: These then of the earth and\\nwater together, rules are to bee knowne,\\n\\n1 _The earth and the water doe make one globe, i.e., one round or\\nsphericall body._\\n\\nThe naturall place of the water is to bee aboue the earth, and\\nsoe it was in the first creation of it, compassing, the earth\\nround aboute as appeares Genes. 1. 9. But for the vse of man and\\nall other liuing creatures, God made a separation of them\\ncaussing the waters to sinke downe into huge hollow channells,\\nprepared to receaue it, that so the drie land might appeare aboue\\nit. Notwithstanding which separation, they doe both still remaine\\ntogether, not couering one another as at first, but intermingled\\none with another, and that soe exactly as they now make but one\\nround body, whereas at first they made two. Here therfore are two\\npoynts to be proued, 1. That they are one globe. 2. that this one\\nis round.\\n\\n1 They are one globe hauing the same Center or middle pointe, and\\nthe same surface or conuexe superficies, which will appeare by\\nthese reasons.\\n\\n1 Common experience. Take a lumpe of earth and any quantity of\\nwater, and let them both fall downe together vpon the earth from\\nsome high place, wee see that in the desc[~e]t they doe not\\nseuer, but keepe still together in on streight line, which could\\nnot bee, if the earth and water were two seuerall round bodies\\nhauing seuerall centers. As for example suppose them to bee two\\nglobes and let (_a_) bee the Center of the earth and (_b_) the\\ncenter of the water; fr[~o] (_c_) some high place aboue the earth\\nhurle downe earth and water, I say the earth will part from the\\nwater in going downe and the earth will fall downe vpon (_d_) &\\nthe water vpon (_e_) but this is contrary to experience & _ergo_\\nthe supposition is false.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n2 The shadow which in Eclipses is cast vpon the Moone by the\\nearth and the water, is but one and not two, & therefore the body\\nis so likewise. This will appeare in the proofe of the next\\npoint, v. 2.\\n\\n2 _That both earth and water are one round body, not square,\\nlong, hollow, of any other figure. This is proued by diuerse\\nreasons._\\n\\n1 By Eclipses; when the earth, stands iust betweene the Sunne and\\nthe Moone, then doth the shadow of the earth falling vpon the\\nMoone darken it wholy or in part. Now as is the fashion of the\\nshadow, such is the figure of the body, whence it falls, but the\\nshadow of the earth and water cast vpon the Moone is round, and\\nalso one, therefore they are round and also one body.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n2 By the orderly and successiue appearing of the starres, as men\\ntrauile from North to South, or from South to North, by sea or\\nland. For as they goe by degrees, they discouer new starres,\\nwhich they saw not before, and loose the sight of them they did,\\nwhich could not bee if the earth were not round. As for example,\\nlet (_X.O.R._) the inward Circle bee the earth, (_Q.S.P._) the\\noutward, the Heauen: they cannot see the starre (_S_) which dwell\\nvpon the earth in (_X_) but if they goe Northward vnto (_O_) they\\nmay see it. If they goe farther to (_R_) they may see the starre\\n(_P_) but then they loose the sight of the starre (_Q_) which\\nbeing at (_X_) and (_O_) they might haue seene. Because, as it\\nappeares in the figure, the earth riseth vp round betweene (_R_)\\nand (_X_).\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n3 By the orderly and successiue rising of the Sunne and starres,\\nand settinge of the same. Which appeare not at the same time to\\nall countryes, but vnto one after another. As for example, let\\n(_F.C.B._) be the Circle of the earth, (_D.E.A._) the Circle of\\nthe heauen from East to west, let (_A_) bee the Sunne or a\\nstarre. When the Sunne (_A_) is vp, and shines vpon them that\\ndwell in (_B_) hee is not risen to them that dwell in (_C_)\\nagaine when hee is risen higher and is come to (_E_) and so\\nshines vpon those that dwell in (_C_) hee is not yet vp to them\\nthat dwell in (_F_). Againe when hee setts in the West, in (_D_)\\nand so is out of sight to the inhabitants in (_B_) hee is yet vp\\nto them that dwell in (_C_) and (_F_). Which shews plainely the\\nearth is round.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n4 By the different obseruations of Eclipses. One and the same\\nEclipse appearing sooner to the Easterly Nations then those that\\nlye farther west, which is caused by the bulke of the earth\\nswelling vp betweene. As for example.\\n\\nLet (_X.O._) bee the Circle of the earth, and the greater the\\nCircle of the heauen from East to West. Let (_P.Q._) bee the body\\nof the Sunne, (_W.S._) of the Moone in the eclipse by reason of\\nthe earth betweene it and the Sunne. It is manifest that the\\ninhabitants in (_O_) shall see the eclipse before the inhabitants\\nin (_X_) by certaine houres, according as the distance betweene\\n(_X_) and (_O_) is more or lesse. They that dwell in (_O_) shall\\nsee it in (_S_) they that dwell in (_X_) see it not till it come\\nto (_W_) a great deale higher.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n5 That the water is round besides the naturall weight and\\nmoisture of it, which being apt to yeeld and runne abroad, will\\nnot suffer some places to ly high, and some low, like hills, &\\ndales, but though it be made rough and vneuen by tempest, doth\\npres[~e]tly returne to their naturall smoothnesse and euennesse:\\nI say besides this: it is cleare by common experience; for if wee\\nstand on the land, and see a ship goe forth to sea, by degrees\\nwee loose the sight of it, first of the bulke then of the\\nmast, and all. So also one the other side they that are at sea by\\ndegrees doe loose or gaine the sight of the Land: As for example.\\n\\nLet (_A_) bee some steeple vpon the land (_B_) a shipp at sea: He\\nthat stands at (_A_) shall by little and little loose the sight\\nof the ship, as shee goes out, & gett sight of her as shee comes\\nin. Both first and last hee shall haue the sight of the top mast\\n(_B_) when hee sees nothing else. Because the sea riseth vp\\nbetweene his sight and the ship.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThese reasons and experiments may suffice to proue the roundnesse\\nof the earth and water; which might bee farther demonstrated by\\nshewing the falshood of all other figures regular or irregular\\nthat can be giuen vnto it; that it is neither square, nor\\nthree-cornerd, nor Piramidall, nor conicall on Taperwise,\\nnor Cylindricall like a barley rowle, nor hollow like a dish,\\nnor of any other fashion, as some haue imagined it to bee of.\\nWee come to this second rule.\\n\\n2 _The tops of the highest hills, and the bottoms of the lowest\\nvallies although in seuerall places they make the earth vneven,\\nyet being compared to the vast greatnesse of the whole, doe not\\nat all hinder the roundnesse of it._\\n\\nAmong all Geometricall figures the sph\\u00e6riall or the round is the\\nmost perfect, and amongst all naturall bodies the heauen is the\\nmost excellent. It was therefore good reason the most beautifull\\nbody should haue the most perfect and exquisite shape. Exact\\nroundnesse then is not found in any body, but the Heauens; the\\nearth is round as was showed before, but not precisely, with out\\nall roughnes and in\\u00e6quality of its surface. There are hills like\\nwarts and vallies like wrinkels in a mans body; and that both for\\nornament and vse. Yet is there such vnformity in this varietie,\\nas that there is no notable and sensible in\\u00e6quality made in the\\nearth by Hills and vallies. No more then if you should lay a fly\\nvpon a smooth Cartwheele, or a pinnes head vpon a greate globe.\\nNow that this is soe appeares by Sense and Reason. By Sense thus,\\nIf wee stand on a hill or in a plaine, when wee may discrie the\\ncountry round about 15. or 20. miles; wee may behold the brim or\\nedge of the earth round about vs to bee in a manner euen and\\nstreight, euen there, where the country is very hilly, and full\\nof mountaines. So that a farre of their height makes but a little\\nalteration and difference from the plaine Countreys, when wee\\nbehold all togeather a farre of: though when wee come neere, the\\nalteration seemes more sensible.\\n\\nBy reason thus, the thicknesse of halfe the earth is (as shall be\\nshewed) about 4000 miles, now the plumb height of the highest\\nmountaines is not accounted aboue a mile and a halfe, or two\\nmiles at the most. Now betweene two miles and foure thousand,\\nthere is no sensible proportion, and a line that is foure\\nthousand and two miles long, will not seeme sensibly longer then\\nthat which is foure thousand; as for example. Let (_O_) be the\\ncenter of the earth, (_XW_) a part of the circle of the earth\\nwhich runneth by the bottomes of the hils and superficies of\\nchampion and even plaines (_WO_) or (_XO_) is the semidiamiter or\\nhalfe the depth of the earth. (_S_) is a hill rising vp aboue\\nthat plaine of the earth, (_WS_) is the plumb height of the hill.\\nI say that (_WS_) doth not sensibly alter the length of the line\\n(_OW_); for (_WS_) is but two miles. (_WO_) 4000 miles, and two\\nto 4000 alters not much more, then the breadth of a pinne to the\\nlength of a pearch. So a line drawne from (_O_) the center to\\n(_S_) the top of the hill, is in a manner all one with a line\\ndrawen to (_W_) the bottome of the hill.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe third rule.\\n\\n3 _The earth resteth immovable in the very midst of the whole\\nearth._\\n\\nTwo points are here to be demonstrated. _First that the earth\\nstandeth exactly in the midst of the World. Secondly that it is\\nimmoveable._ The former is proved by these reasons.\\n\\n1 The naturall heavinesse of the earth and water is such, as they\\nwill never cease mooving downewards till they come to the lowest\\nplace; Now the center or middle point of the world is the lowest\\nplace, and _ergo_ they must needs moue thither, as for example.\\n\\nLet (_O_) be the center of the world, (_CDE_) the heauens: it is\\nmanifest that the lowest place from the heauens on all sides is\\n(_O_). Ssuppose the earth to be in (_A_) or in (_B_) some where\\nout of the center, I say it is not possible (vnlesse it be\\nviolently held vp) that it should abide there, but it will\\ndescend till it come to (_O_) the middle point.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n2 If the earth stood any where but in the midest we should not\\nsee halfe the heauens aboue vs, as now we alway doe, neither\\ncould there be any \\u00c6quinox, neither would the daies and nights\\nlengthen and shorten in that due order and proportion in all\\nplaces of the World as now they doe; againe Eclipses would never\\nfall out but in one part of the heavens, yea the Sunne and Moone\\nmight be directly opposite one to another and yet no Eclipse\\nfollow, all which are absurd. As for example, let the center of\\nthe World be (_O_) let the earth stand in (_A_), a good way\\ndistant from the center, it is manifest that the greater halfe of\\nthe Heauens (_CIB_) will alwaies be aboue, and the lesser halfe\\n(_CDB_) below, which is contrary to experience. Thence also it\\nfollowes that the daies and nights will never be equall, for the\\nSunne (_B_) will be alwaies longer aboue the earth whil'st he\\nmoues from (_B_) to (_C_) then below, mouing from (_C_) to (_B_).\\nAgaine the Sunne (_B_) may stand iust opposite to the Moone (_X_)\\nand yet noe Eclipse follow, the earth which makes the Eclipse,\\nstanding out of the midst.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n3 The shadowes of all bodies on the earth would not fall in that\\norderly vniformity as they now doe: for if the earth stood\\ntowards the East, the shadowes would be shortest before noone, if\\ntoward the west afternoone, if towards the North, the shadowes\\nwould still fall Northward, if towards the South, Southwards, all\\nwhich experience shewes to be false. As for example, let the\\nearth stand Eastwards in (_A_) the shadow of any body vpon the\\nearth, as of the body vnder (_E_) will be shorter in the morning\\nwhen the sunne is in (_C_), then at noone when the sunne is in\\n(_X_). If the earth stand Southward in (_W_) the shaddow of any\\nbody will alwaies fall south, as it doth in the figure (_Y_) and\\n(_Z_.)\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n_The second thing to be proued was that the earth is immouable._\\nwhere wee must vnderstand a double motion, Streight, or Circular.\\nFor the first it is cleare that with out supernaturall violence\\nit cannot bee moued in any streight motion, that is, vpward\\ndownewarde, or toward any side; it cannot bee shoued out of his\\nplace.\\n\\nFor the Second, whether abiding still in his place it may not\\nmoue rounde, the question is disputed, and maintained one both\\nsides. Some affirme it may, and doth: who thinke there is greater\\nprobabilitie the earth should mooue round once a day, then that\\nthe Heauens should by reason of the incredible swiftnesse of the\\nheauens motion, scarcs conpetible to any naturall body; and the\\nmore likely Slownesse of the earths mouing. Others deny it\\ngrounding theire opinion vpon Scripture, which affirmes the earth\\nto stand fast, so as it cannot bee moued; and vpon Sence, because\\nwee perceaue it not to moue, and lastly vpon reasons drawne from\\nthings hurled vp, and let fall vpon the earth. The arguments on\\nboth sides wil bee more easie to bee vnderstood by the figure\\nthat followes.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nIn this figure it is manifest, that the earth in the midest,\\ncannot moue by any streight motion, vpward towarde (_N_) or\\nsideward toward (_M_) or any other way out of its proper place,\\nand therefore that opinion of _Copernicus_ and others, that the\\nearth should moue round once a yeere in such a Circle as (_MPR_)\\nis most improbable & vnreasonable. And reiected by the most.\\n\\nBut although it cannot moue streight, it may moue round. For\\nthough it be a marueilous great body of vnconceaueable weight,\\nyet being equally poised on euery side, there is nothing can\\nhinder its Circular motion. As in a Globe of Lead, or any other\\nheauy substance, though it were 40. Fadome in compasse, yet being\\nset vpon his two Poles, it would easily bee turned round euen\\nwith a touch of ones little finger. And therefore it is concluded\\nthat this circular motion is not impossible. The probabilitie of\\nit is thus made plaine. The whole circuit of the Heauens, wherein\\nare the fixed Starrs is reckoned by Astronomers to bee\\n1017562500. that is a Thousand and seauenteene Millions of miles,\\nfiue hundred sixty two thousand, and fiue hundred miles. Let this\\nbee the compasse of the Circle (_NMOZ_.) So many miles doth the\\nHeauens moue in one day, till the same point come to the place\\nfrom whence it went; as till (_N_) moue round, and come to (_N_)\\nagaine. This being the motion of the whole day 24. houres, how\\nmany miles will (_N_) moue in one houre? it will moue 42398437\\nand a halfe. i.e. Forty two Millions three hundred ninty eight\\nthousand, foure hundred thirty seuen miles and an halfe. So many\\nmiles will (_N_) moue in one houre, from (_N_) to (_M_.) A motion\\nso swift that it is vtterly incredible. Farre more likely it is,\\nthe circuit of the earth (_ASXV_) being about 24000. i.e. twenty\\nfoure thousand miles more or lesse, it should moue round once a\\nday. For then one point as (_X_) should moue in one houre from\\n(_X_) to (_V_) but a thousand miles, which motion although it bee\\nswifter then any arrow or bullet from a Cannons mouth, yet is it\\nincomparably slower then that of the Heauens, where so many\\nMillions are posted ouer in an houre.\\n\\nNow for the saluing of all the c\\u00e6lestiall Ph\\u00e6nomena, or\\nappearances, the truth is the same, if wee suppose the earth to\\nmoue, as if wee beleeue it to stand still. The riseing of the\\nSunne and Starres, the motions of all the Planets, will keepe\\nCorrespondence that now. Nor neede wee feare logging, or that\\nsteples and towers would totter downe, for the motion is regular,\\nand steady without rubbes, and knocks. As if you turne a globe\\nabout, it will goe steadyly, and a fly will set fast vpon it,\\nthough you moue it apace. Besides the whole body the ayre is\\ncarryed about with the whirlinge of the earth, so that the earth\\nwill make noe winde, as it turnes swiftly about; as a wheele\\nwill, if it bee turned apace.\\n\\nNotwithstanding all this, most are of another opinion, that the\\nearth standeth still without all motion, rest rather befittinge\\nso heauy and dull a body then motion. The maine reason brought to\\nestablish it is this. Let a stone bee throwne downe out of the\\nayre from (_W_:) if the earth stand still, it is manifest it will\\nfall vpon (_X_) iust vnder it; as wee see it doth by common\\nexperience, a stone will fall downe from any height vpon the\\nplace wee aymed at, but let the earth moue, the stone will not\\nlight vpon (_X_) but some where else as one (_S_:) for (_X_) will\\nbee moued away, and gone to (_V_.)\\n\\nSo againe let two peices of ordinance that will shoote at equall\\ndistance bee discharged one iust towards the East, the other\\ntowards the West; if the earth moue (as they say it doth) towards\\nthe West, the bullet that is discharged Eastward will fly farther\\nthen that Westward. For by the contrary motion of the earth hee\\nwill gaine ground. But experience hath proued this to bee false,\\nshewing that the bullets, will both fly at equall distance.\\n\\nTo salue this, answere is made that the earth by its swift motion\\ncarries with it and that steadily not only all bodies resting or\\nmoueing vpon it, but also the whole Sph\\u00e6re of Aire (_WEQ_) with\\nall things whatsoeuer that are moued in it naturally or\\nviolently, as clouds, birds, stones hurled vp or downe, arrowes,\\nbullets, and such like things violently shott forth: as may\\nappeare in the figure.\\n\\nThe fourth rule.\\n\\n4 The earth, though it bee of exceeding greate quantity being\\nconsidered in itselfe, yet being compared to the Heauens,\\nespecially the higher sph\\u00e6res, is of noe notable bignes, but may\\nbe accounted as a point or pricke in the middest of the world.\\n\\nThat the earth is noe bigger then a point or pinns head in\\ncomparison of the highest heauens will easily appeare vnto vs, by\\nthese reasons.\\n\\n1 The starres which are many times bigger then the earth, seeme\\nyet to vs to bee noe bigger then a greate pinns head, or such\\nlike quantity; therefore much lesse shall the earth appeare to\\nbee of any sensible magnitude.\\n\\n2 Wee alwaies beholde halfe the heauens aboue vs, which could not\\nbee if the earth had any sensible proportion to the heauen.\\n\\n3 All obseruations of hights and distances of the coelestiall\\nbodies, which are made on the superficies of the earth, are as\\nexact, and true, as if they were made in the very center of the\\nearth. Which were impossible, vnlesse the thicknes of the earth\\nwere insensible in regard of the Heauens.\\n\\n4 All Sunn Dialls which stand on the superficies of the earth,\\ndoe as truely cast the shadowes of the houres, as if they stood\\nin the Center. As for example.\\n\\nThe starre (_S_) appeares like a point or pricke to them that\\ndwell in (_A_) wherefore the earth (_OX_) will appeare much lesse\\nto the sight of him that should behold it from (_S_), nay it\\nwould not bee seene at all. Againe halfe the Heauens (_BFE_) are\\nalwayes seene to th[~e] that dwell in (_A_) wanting some two\\nminutes, betweene (_ED_) and (_BC_) which difference is\\nalltogether insensible. Againe if wee obserue the height of the\\nstarre (_S_) aboue the Horizon (_BE_) it will bee all one namely\\n(_BS_) whether wee obserue it in the topp of the earth, in (_A_)\\nor in the middle in (_O_.) For, (_A_) and (_O_,) are so little\\ndistant one from another, that (_AS_,) and (_OS_) will bee\\nparalell lines, and bee esteemed but as one line. The fourth\\nreason concerning Dialls, is cleare by the framing and\\nconstruction of them: wherein either the lower end of the Cocke\\n(or Gnomon) whereat all the houre lines meet, or the vpper end\\nand knobb (as in many Dialls) is supposed to bee the Center of\\nthe earth.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CAP. 3.\\n\\n            _Of the parts of the terrestriall Globe._\\n\\n\\nThe properties of the earthly Globe haue beene handled in the\\nformer chapter wee come now to the parts which are two in\\ngenerall.\\n\\n    {Earth} Both containe vnder them more particular\\n    {Water} parts to be knowne.\\n\\nThe more notable parts of the Earth are these.\\n\\n1 A Continent or maine Land, or as some call it firme Land, which\\nis not parted by the Sea running betweene.\\n\\n2 An Iland, a land compassed about with waters.\\n\\n3 A Peninsula, a land almost surrounded by waters saue at one\\nplace, where ioynes by a narrow necke of land to the Continent;\\nthis is also called Chersonesus.\\n\\n4 An Isthmus, a streight necke of land which ioynes two countreys\\ntogether, and keepes the Sea from compassing the one.\\n\\n5 A Promontorie or head land running farre out into the Sea like\\na wedge.\\n\\n6 A Mountaine      }\\n                   }\\n7 A Valley         } All easie to bee knowne\\n                   }\\n8 A Champion plain } without any definition.\\n                   }\\n9 A Wood           }\\n\\nThe more notable parts of the Water are these\\n\\n1 _Mare_ the Sea, or Ocean, which is the gathering together of\\nall waters.\\n\\n2 _Fretum_ a streight or narrow sea running betweene two lands.\\n\\n3 _Sinus_ a Creeke, Gulfe, or Bay, when the sea runnes vp into\\nthe bosome of the land by a narrow enterance but openeth it\\nbroader when it is within; if it bee very litell it is called a\\nHauen, _Portus_.\\n\\n4 _Lacus_ a Lake, a little sea with in the land hauing riuers\\nrunning into it, or out of it, or both. If it hath neither it is\\ncalled _Stagnum_ a standing Poole, also _Palus_; a fenne.\\n\\n5 _Fluvius_ a Riuer, which from the pleasantnesse is also called\\n_Amnis_; from the smalnesse of it _Rivus_.\\n\\nNow concerning these parts diuers questions are moued; whether\\nthere bee more Sea or Land? whether the sea would naturally\\nouerflow the land, as it did in the first creation, were it not\\nwithheld within his bankes by diuine power? whether the deepenes\\nof the Sea, doth exceede the height of the mountaines? whether\\nmountaines were before the flood? what is the hight of the\\nhighest hilles? whether Iland, came since the flood? what is the\\ncause of the Ebbing and flowing of the Sea? what is the original\\nof springs and riuers? what manner of motion the running of the\\nriuers is? with such like, whereof some belong not so properly to\\nthis science of Geography as to others. Wee speake onely a word\\nor two of the last, & so proceed. The question is whether the\\nmotion of the riuers bee streight, or Circular. The doubts on\\nboth sides will best appeare by a figure first drawne: wherein,\\nLet (_HMO_) be the Meridian of _Alexandria_ in _\\u00c6gipt_, or of the\\nMouth of _Nilus_ and answerable to the meridian of the Heauens.\\nAnother in the Earth (_XBY_.) Let (_B_) bee the mouth of _Nilus_,\\nand (_C_) the fountaine and head of it. Now the mouth of _Nilus_,\\nwhere it runnes into the mediterranian Sea, is placed by\\ngeographers in the 31. degree of the North latitud; & the head of\\n_Nilus_ where it riseth is placed by _Polomeus_ in 11. degree of\\nthe South latitud, but by latter & more exact geographers in the\\n14. degree of the Southern latitud, so that the distance betweene\\nthe founts & _Ostia_ i.e. betweene (_C_) and (_B_) is 45. degrees\\nof a great Circle, which after the vsuall account makes 2700. one\\neight part of the earths compasse. The qu\\u00e6stion now is, whether\\nthe runninge from (_C_) to (_B_) runne continually downward in a\\nstreight line; or circularly in a crooked line. If it runne in a\\nstreight line, as is most agreeable to the nature of the water it\\nmust moue either by the line (_CEB_) or by the line (_DB_.) By\\nthe line (_CEB_) it cannot moue: for when it is come to (_E_,) it\\nwill stand still. Because from (_E_) to (_B_) it must moue\\nvpward, if it moue at all, which is contrary to the nature of\\nwater. If therefore it moue by a streight line it can bee noe\\nother, but (_BD_,) and so from (_D_) to (_B_) it shall\\ncontinually descend; for of all places betweene (_D_,) & (_B_)\\n(_B_) is the nearest to (_A_.) But then the fountaine must not\\nbee in (_B_) but higher in (_D_) which semees altogether\\nimprobable or impossible. For first the line (_AD_) would bee\\nnotably and sent by longer then the line (_AB_) For the compasse\\nof the earth being about 24000. Miles, and the semidiameter\\n(_AB_,) or (_AC_) 3828. miles the line (_CD_,) would bee 1581.\\nmiles, which cannot bee true, if as wee haue proued before, the\\nearth bee round, and that the highest hills make noe sensible\\nin\\u00e6quality. Againe they that dwell in (_D_) should see the North\\nPole starre (_N_) as well as they that dwell in (_B_,) which also\\nis false. So then the riuer cannot runne either by (_EB_) or\\n(_DB_) Runnes it then circularly by the line (_CWB_?) This seemes\\nprobable, and the rather because heereby a reason of the\\noriginall of Riuers might more easily bee giuen. For the\\nfountaines (_C_) lying euen with the superficies of the Sea, the\\nwater may easily passe through the hollowes of the earth, and\\nbreake out at (_C_) without ascendinge. But here also are some\\ndifficulties: for first wee find by experience that the\\nfountaines of most riuers, and those greate ons too, lye sensibly\\nhigher then the plaine surface of the Sea. Againe, if the riuer\\nmoue directly round, what should bee the cause that begins and\\ncontinues this motion? It is a motion besides the nature of the\\nwater, and therefore violent, what should driue it forward from\\nthe Sea to (_C_,) and from (_C_) to (_B_,) when the water is at\\n(_C_) or (_W_,) it is as neere to the Center (_A_) as when it is\\nat (_B_,) and therefore it should seeme with more liklyhood it\\nwould stand still; for why should it striue to goe further,\\nseeing where it is, it is as neare to the Center as whither it\\nrunnes. Or if some violence doe driue it from (_C_,) towards\\n(_W_,) yet (as it is the nature of violent motions) the further\\nit goes the slower it will runne, till in the end it stand still,\\nif there bee noe aduantadge of ground to helpe it forward.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nAs a bowle throwne downe a hill runnes easily and farre, if it\\nonce bee sett a going; but throwne vpon the ice (an euen place)\\nit will without any lett at last stand still. Answere may bee\\nmade hereunto, that although there bee noe aduantage of the\\nground, yet the water will still moue forwarde from (_C_) to\\n(_B_) because the water that followes, pusheth forwarde that,\\nthat runnes afore. Which answere will stand, when a good cause\\nmay bee shewed, which forcibly driueth the water from the Sea\\nvnto (_C_) and out of the fountaine (_C_;) considering that\\n(after this supposition) they lie both in the same circular\\nsuperficies. Wherefore seeing, wee cannot without any\\ninconueniency suppose it to moue by any of these lines either\\nstreight as (_BC_) or (_BD_,) or circular as (_BWC_) let vs\\nenquire farther.\\n\\nThe most likely opinion is, that the motion of the water is mixt\\nneither directly streight, or circular, but partly one, partly\\nthe other. Or if it be circular, it is in a circle whose center\\nis a little distant from the Center of the whole globe. Let vs\\nplace fountaines then neither in (_C_) nor (_D_) but in (_F_) I\\nsay the water runnes either partly streight by the (_FS_) and\\npartly circular, from (_S_) to (_B_) which motion will not be\\ninconuenient, for the water descending continually from (_F_) to\\n(_S_) will cause it still to runne forward; or else wholy\\ncircular in the circle (_FXB_.) And this is most agreeable to\\ntruth. For so it shall both runne round as it must doe if wee\\nwill escape the otherwise vnauoidable inconueniences of the first\\nopinion and yet in running still descend, and come neerer to the\\nCenter, as is most befitting the nature of water, so that wee\\nneed not seeke for any violent cause that moues it. Let vs then\\nsee what is the hight of (_F_) the fountaines of _Nilus_, aboue\\n(_C_) that is (_B_) the mouth or outlet of it into the Sea. The\\nvsuall allowance in watercourses is one foot in descent for 200.\\nfoot in running, but if this bee thought to much because water\\nwill runne awaie vpon any inequality of ground, for euery 500.\\nfoote allow one for descent, & so much we may with reason, in\\nregard of the swiftnes of many riuers, yea the most, which in\\nmany places runnes headlong, in all places very swiftly\\n(especially _Nilus_ whose cateracts or downfalls are notable)\\nwhich cannot bee without some notable decliuity of the ground.\\nThus then the whole course of _Nilus_ being 2700. miles from\\n(_F_) to (_B_) the perpendicular or plumb descent of it (_CF_)\\nwill be 5. miles. And so high shall the fountaine stand aboue the\\nmouth, and the surface of the plaine Land (for riuers commonly\\narise at foot of hills) which is (_BXF_) swell vp aboue the\\nsurface of the Sea (_BWC_) or (_BY_) which hight of the Land\\naboue the Sea although it bee greater then is the height of the\\nhighest mo[~u]taines aboue the plaine Land, yet it is nothing in\\ncomparison of the whole Earth. And this being granted (as with\\nmost probabilitie of reason it may) it will appeare that God in\\nthe beginning of the world imposed noe perpetuall violence vpon\\nnature, in gathering togeather, the waters into one place, and\\nbeing so gathered in keeping them from runing backe to cover the\\nearth. At the first so soone as those hollow channells were\\nprepared, the water did naturally slide downe into them, and out\\nof them without miraculous power they cannot returne. For if the\\nsea (_BY_) should overflow the land towards (_F_) the water must\\nascend in running from (_B_) to (_F_) which is contrary to its\\nnature. Certainly the midland countries, whence springs of great\\nrivers vsually arise, doe ly so high, that the sea cannot\\nnaturally overflow them. For as for that opinion that the water\\nof the sea in the middle lies on a heape higher then the water\\nthat is by the shore; and so that it is a harder matter to saile\\nout of a Haven to seaward, then to come in (because they goe\\nvpward): this is an empty speculation contray to experience, and\\nthe grounds of nature it selfe, as might easily be shewed. All\\nthe difficulty that is in this opinion, is to giue a reason how\\nthe waters mount vp to (_F_,) and whence the water comes that\\nshould flow out of so high a place of the earth, wherein I thinke\\nas in many other secrets of nature we must content our selues\\nwith ignorance, seeing so many vaine conjectures haue taken no\\nbetter successe.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CAP. 4.\\n\\n                 _Of the circles of the earth._\\n\\n\\nIn a round body as the earth is, there can be no distinction of\\nparts, & places, without the helpe of some lines drawen or\\nimagined to be drawen vpon it. Now though there are not, nor can\\nbe any circles truly drawen vpon the earth, yet because there is\\na good ground in nature and reason of things for them, we must\\nimagine them to be drawen vpon the earth, as truly as we see them\\ndescribed vpon a Globe or in a plaine paper. Further this must be\\nnoted, that all circles on the earth haue the like opposite vnto\\nthem conceaved to be the Heavenes, vnder which they are directly\\nscituated. Thus knowen, the circles that wee are to take the\\nspeciall notice of are of two sorts, Greater and Lesser.\\n\\n_The greater circles are those which devide this earthly globe\\ninto equall halfes or H\\u00e6mispheres._\\n\\n_The lesser are those which devide it into two vnequall parts,\\none bigger, another lesse._\\n\\n                         { 1 \\u00c6quator.\\nOf the former sort there { 2 Meridian.\\nare foure, the           { 3 Horizon.\\n                         { 4 Zodiack, or Eclipticke.\\n\\n1 _The \\u00c6quitor or \\u00c6quonoctiall line, is a line drawen iust in the\\nmidst of the earth, from East to West, which compasseth it as a\\ngirdle doth a mans body, and devidith it into two equall parts,\\none on the North side, the other on the South_ The two points in\\nthe earth that are every way farthest distant from it North, &\\nSouth are called the Poles of the earth which doe directly stand\\nvnder the two like points in the Heaven, so called because the\\nHeaven turnes about vpon them, as the Earth doth in a Globe\\nthat's set in a frame. This circle is of the first & principall\\nnote and vse in Geography, because all measurings for distances\\nof places and quarters of the Earth are reckoned in it, or from\\nit. It is called the \\u00c6quinoctiall, because when the Sunne in the\\nHeavens comes to be directly over that circle in the earth, the\\ndaies & nights are of equall length in all parts of the world.\\nMarriners call it by a kind of excellency, _The line_. Vpon the\\nGlobe it is easily discerned being drawen bigger then any other\\ncircles from East to West, and with small divisions.\\n\\n2 _The Meridian, if a line that is drawen quite crosse the\\n\\u00c6quinoctiall, and passeth through the Poles of the Earth, going\\ndirectly North and South._ It is called the Meridian, because\\nwhen the Sunne stands just over that circle it is _Meridies i.d._\\nnoone day. It may be conceaued thus, at noone day, when it is\\njust twelue a clocke, turne your face towards the South, and then\\nimagine with your selfe two circles drawen, one in the Heavens,\\npassing from the North iust over your head through the body of\\nthe Sunne downe to the South, and so round vnder the earth vp\\nagaine to the North Pole. Another vpon the surface of the earth\\npassing through your feete just vnder the Sunne, and so\\ncompassing the earth round till it meete at your feete againe,\\nand these are Meridians answering one to another. Now the\\nMeridian is not one only, as was the \\u00c6quinoctiall, but many still\\nvarying according to the place wherein you are, as for example.\\nAt _London_ there is one Meridian, at _Oxford_ another, at\\n_Bristow_ another, & so along Eastward or Westward. For it is\\nnoone at _London_ sooner then at _Oxford_, and at _Oxford_ sooner\\nthen at _Bristow_. Vpon the globe there are many drawen, all\\nwhich passe through the poles, and goe North and South, but there\\nis one more remarkeable then the rest, drawen broad with small\\ndivisions, which runneth through the Canary Ilands, or through\\nthe Ilands of _Azores_ Westward of _Spaine_, which is counted the\\nfirst Meridian in regard of reckoning and measuring of distances\\nof places one from another; for otherwise there is neither first\\nnor last in the round earth. But some place must bee appointed\\nwhere to beginne the account and those Ilands haue beene thought\\nfittest, because no part of the World that lay westward was\\nknowne to the Ancients further then that: and as they began to\\nreckon there, we follow them. This circle is called in greeke\\n[Greek: Mes\\u00eambrinos].\\n\\n3. The Horizon is two fold: { Sensible or appearing.\\n                            { Intelligible or true.\\n\\n_The Sensible or appearing Horizon is the space of the earth so\\nfarre as in an open plaine, or vpon some Hill a man may see round\\nabout him._ The brim or edge of the earth further then which you\\ncannot see, that is the Horizon, or as some call it the\\n_Finitor_. Because _finet_ or terminat _visum_ it setts the\\nlimits or bounds to your sight, beyond which nothing can bee\\nseene vpon the earth. This is greater or lesser, according as the\\nheight of the eye aboue the plaine superficies of the earth, is\\nmore or lesse. The most exact triall hereof is at Sea, where\\nthere are no mountaines nor any vnequall risings of the water to\\nhinder the sight, as there are at land. For example let (_CBAF_)\\nbe the superficies of the Sea and let a mans eye bee placed in\\n(_X_) aboue the Sea; as the eye stands higher or lower so will\\nthe distance seene be more or lesse, as if the hight of (_XA_) be\\n6 foot which is ordinary the height of a man, the eye looking\\nfrom (_X_) to (_B_) shall see 2 miles and 3 quarters, if (_X_) be\\n20 foote high (_BA_) will bee fiue miles, if 40 foote 7 miles, if\\n50 foote 8 miles.[1] So that from the mast of a ship 50 foote\\nhigh, a man may see round about at sea 8 miles every way, toward\\n(_BG_) and (_F_). So farre may the water it selfe be seene, but\\nany high thing on the Water may be seene farther, 16, or 20 miles\\naccording as the height is, as the ship at (_C_) may be seene\\nfrom (_X_) as far more as it is from (_A_) to (_B_). There can be\\ntherefore no certaine quantity and space set downe for this\\nsensible Horizon, which continually varies according to the\\nheight of the eye aboue the plaine ground or sea. This Horrizon\\nis not at all painted on the globe nor can be.\\n\\n[Footnote 1: See _Wright_ of Navigation p. 229.]\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n_The intelligible or true Horizon is a line which girts the earth\\nround in the midst, and divides it into two equall parts or\\nH\\u00e6mispheares the vppermost vpon the top & middle point\\nwhereof wee dwell, and that which is vnder vs._ Opposite to this\\nin the Heavens is another Horizon, which likewise cuts the Heaven\\ninto two Hemispheres, the vpper and the lower. Aboue which circle\\nwhen any starre or the Sunne is moued, it then riseth vnto vs,\\nand setteth vnto those that dwell opposite vnto vs, and so on the\\ncontrary, you may conceiue it best thus, if standing vpon a hill,\\nor some open place, where you may perfectly see the setting of\\nthe Sunne, you marke when the Sun is halfe gone out of your\\nsight, you may perceiue the body of the Sunne cut in two, as it\\nwere by a line, going along through it, the halfe aboue is yet\\nseene, that vnderneath is gone out of your sight. This line is\\nbut a peece of the Horrizon, which if you conceiue to be drawen\\nvpward about the World from the West to the North, and so by East\\nand South, to West againe you haue the whole Horrizon described.\\n\\nThis circle is not drawen vpon the body of the globe, because it\\nis variable; but stands one the outside of it, beeing a broad\\ncircle of wood couered with paper on which are sett the moneths\\nand days of the yeare, both in the old and new Calender, and also\\nthe 12 signes, and the points of the compasse. All which are\\neasily discerned by the beholdinge. The vse of this Horizon is\\nnot so much in Geographie as in Astronomie.\\n\\n_The Zodiake is a circle which compasseth the earth like a belt,\\ncrossing the \\u00e6quator slopewise, not streight as the Meridians\\ndoe._ Opposite to it in the Heauens is another circle of the same\\nname, wherein are the 12. signes, and in which the Sunne keepes\\nhis owne proper course all the yeare long, neuer declining from\\nit on the one side or other. The vse hereof in Geography is but\\nlitle only to shew what people they are ouer whose heads the\\nSunne comes to bee once or twice a yeare; who are all those that\\ndwell with in 23. degrees of the Aequator; for so much is the\\ndeclination, or sloping of the _Zodiacke_. This circle is also\\ncalled the Eclipticke line, because when the Sunne and Moone\\nstand both in this circle opposite each to other, then there\\nhappens an Eclipse of the Sunne or Mone, vpon a globe it is\\neasily discerned, by the sloping of it from the Aequator, and the\\ndiuisions of it into 12. parts, and euery of those 12. into 30.\\ndegrees.\\n\\n_These are the greater circles: the lesser follow; which are all\\nof one nature, and are called by one generall name: sc.\\nParallels, because they are so drawen on each side of the\\nAequator, as they are equidistant vnto it euery way._ Many of\\nthis kinde are drawne vpon the globe (as is easie to bee seene)\\nand may bee conceaued to bee drawne vpon the earth: but there are\\nonly two sorts cheifely to bee marked: namely the\\n\\n    { Tropickes and the }\\n    { Polar circles.    }\\n\\n_The tropickes are two, parallel circles distant on each side of\\nthe Aequator 23. degrees shewing the farthest bounds of the Sunns\\ndeclination North or South from the Aequator, or the midest of\\nheauen._ And therefore they are called tropickes a [Greek:\\ntrep\\u00f4thai] _vertendo_, because when the Sunne comes ouer these\\nlines, hee either turnes away from vs, as in the Summer, or\\nturnes toward vs againe as in the winter: There are then two of\\nthem _vid._\\n\\n    { 1 The Tropicke of Cancer which lies on the North side\\n    {   of the Aequator, to which when the Sunne comes, it\\n    {   makes the longest day in Summer.\\n    {\\n    { 2 The Tropicke of Capricorne, lying Southward of the\\n    {   Aequator, to which when the Sunne comes, it makes the\\n    {   shortest day in winter.\\n\\n_The Polar circles are two parallels drawne by the poles of the\\nZodiacke compassinge about the poles of the world, being distant\\nfrom them euery way 23 degrees. These are two._\\n\\n1 _The Articke Circle that compasseth about the North Pole: it is\\nso called because that in the Heavens (where vnto this in the\\nearth lies opposite) runs through the constellation of the great\\nBeare, which in greeke is called [Greek: arktos]_\\n\\n2 _The Antarticke circle that compasseth about the South Pole, &\\nis placed opposite vnto the former._ All these with the former\\nare easily known vp[~o] the Globe by these descripti[~o]s, &\\nnames vsually added vnto th[~e]. But because maps are of an esier\\nprice, & more c[~o]mon vse then Globes, it will be needfull to\\nshew how all these circles, which are drawne most naturally vpon\\na round Globe, may also as truly, and profitably for knowledge\\nand vse be described vpon a plaine paper. Whereby we shall\\nvnderstand the reason of those lines which We see in the vsuall\\nMapps of the world, both how they are drawne, and wherefore they\\nserue. Vnderstand therefore, that in laying downe the globe vpon\\na plaine paper, you must imagine the globe to be cut in two\\nhalfes through the midst, and so to be pressed downe flat to the\\npaper; as if you should take a hollow dish, and with your hand\\nsquieze the bottom down, till it lie flat vpon a bord, or any\\nother plaine thing for then will those circles that before were\\nof equall distance, runne closer together towards the midst.\\nAfter this conceit, vniversall Maps are made of two fashions,\\naccording as the globe may be devided two waies, either cutting\\nquite through by the meridian from North to South, as if you\\nshould cut an apple by the eye and the stalke, or cutting it\\nthrough the \\u00c6quinoctiall, East and West, as one would divide an\\napple through the midst, betweene the eye & the stalke. The\\nformer makes two faces, or hemispheares, the East and the West\\nhemispheare. The latter makes likewise two Hemispheares, the\\nNorth and the South. Both suppositions are good, and befitting\\nthe nature of the globe: for as touching such vniversall maps,\\nwherein the world is represented not in two round faces, but all\\nin one square plot, the ground wherevpon such descriptions are\\nfounded, is lesse naturall and agreeable to the globe, for it\\nsupposeth the earth to be like a Cylinder (or role of bowling\\nallies) which imagination, vnlesse it be well qualified, is\\nvtterly false,[2] and makes all such mappes faulty in the\\nscituation of places. Wherefore omitting this, we will shew the\\ndescription of the two former only, both which are easie to be\\ndone.\\n\\n[Footnote 2: Of this Hypothesis see _Wrights_ errors of\\nnavigation.]\\n\\n1 To describe an \\u00c6quinoctiall planispheare, draw a circle\\n(_ACBD_) and inscribe in it two diameters (_AB_) & (_CD_) cutting\\neach other at right angles, and the whole circle into foure\\nquadrants: each whereof devide into 90. parts, or degrees. The\\nline (_AB_) doth fitly represent halfe of the \\u00c6quator, as the\\nline (_CD_) in which the points (_C_) & (_D_) are the two poles,\\nhalfe of the Meridian: for these circles the eye being in a\\nperpendicular line from the point of concurrence (as in this\\nprojection it is supposed) must needs appeare streight. To draw\\nthe other, which will appeare crooked, doe thus. Lie a rule from\\nthe Pole (_C_) to every tenth or fift degree of the halfe circle\\n(_ADB_) noting in the \\u00c6quator (_AB_) every intersection of it and\\nthe rule. The like doe from the point (_B_) to the semicircle\\n(_CAD_) noting also the intersections in the Meridian (_CD_) Then\\nthe diameters (_CB_) and (_AB_) being drawne out at both ends, as\\nfarre as may suffice, finding in the line (_DC_) the center of\\nthe tenth division from (_A_) to (_C_) and from (_B_) to (_C_), &\\nof the first point of intersection noted in the meridian fr[~o]\\nthe \\u00c6quator towards (_C_) by a way familiar to Geometricians\\nconnect the three points, and you haue the paralell of 10.\\ndegrees from the \\u00c6quator: the like must bee done in drawing the\\nother paralells on either side, the \\u00c6quator; as also in drawing\\nthe Meridians from centers found in the line (_AB_) in like maner\\ncontinued. All which is illustrated by the following diagram.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n2 To describe a Polar Planisph\\u00e6re, draw a circle (_ACBD_) on the\\ncenter (_E_) & as before, inscribe in it two diameters (_AB_) and\\n(_BC_) cutting each other at right angles, and the circle into\\nfoure quadrants. Each quadrant being deuided into 90. parts, draw\\nfrom euery 5^{th} or 10^{th} of those parts a diameter to the\\nopposite point: these lines all concurring in the center (_E_)\\nbeing the pole, are as so many Meridians. Next, hauing cutt the\\nhalfe of any one of the former diameters into 9 parts, as (_ED_)\\nin the points (_FGHIKLMN_) draw on the center (_E_) so many\\ncircles and these represent the paralells of the Globe, being\\nalso here true paralells.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\n\\n\\n                             CAP. 5.\\n\\n      _Of divers Distinctions, and Divisions of the earth._\\n\\n\\nNext after the Circles of the Earth, wee may not vnfitly handle\\nthe seuerall Divisions and distinctions which geographers make of\\nthe parts, and inhabitants of the earth. These are many, but wee\\nwill briefely runne them ouer.\\n\\n1 The first and most plaine is by the Coasts of the Heauens, and\\nrising, and Setting of the Sunne, so it is distinguished into the\\n    { East where the Sunne ariseth. _Oreins_, _Ortus_\\n    { [Greek: anatol\\u00ea].\\n    { West where the Sunne goeth downe. _occidens_.\\n    { North: betweene both fromwards the Sunne at Noone.\\n    { _Septentrio_.\\n    { South: betweene both towards the Sun at Noone.\\n    { _Meridies_.\\nThese foure are called the cheife or Cardinall quarters of the\\nworld. They with the others betweene them are easily knowne but\\nare of more vse to Mariners then to vs. Wee may rather take\\nnotice of those other names which by Astronomers Geographers\\nDivines and Poets are giuen vnto them. Who sometime call the East\\nthe right hand part of the world, sometime the West, sometime the\\nNorth, & sometime South, the diuersity is noted in these verses,\\n    _Ad Boream terr\\u00e6, Sed Coeli mensor ad Austrum,_\\n    _Pr\\u00e6co Dei exortum videt, occasumque Poeta._\\nThat is\\n    Geographers looke to the North, Astronomers to the South.\\n    Priests turne them to the East, & Poets to the West.\\nThis serues for vnderstanding of Authors, wherein any mention is\\nmade of the right or left part of the World, if for example he be\\na poet, he means the South by the right hand, the North by the\\nleft: because a poet turnes his face to the West, and so reckons\\nthe quarters of Heauen and Earth.\\n\\n2 The second distinction is by the notable differences of heat\\nand cold, that are observed on the earth, this is the division of\\nthe Earth by Zones or Girdles, which are parts of the Earth,\\nwherin heat and cold doe remarkably increase or decrease. Those\\nZones are 5.\\n\\n1 The hot or burning Zone (_Zona torrida_) which containes all\\nthat space of earth, that lieth betwtene the two Tropicks,\\nsupposed heretofore (but falsly as after experience hath shewed)\\nto be inhabitable by reason of heat, the Sunne continually lying\\nouer some part of it.\\n\\n2.3 The temperate Zones wherein neither heat nor cold is extreame\\nbut moderate: these are two, one on the North side of the\\nAequator, betweene the Articke circle, and the Tropicke of\\nCancer, another on the South side betweene the Tropicke of\\nCapricorne, and the Antarcticke circle.\\n\\n4.5 The cold, or Frozen Zones, wherein cold for the most part is\\ngreater then the heat, these likewise are two, one in the North,\\nbetweene the Articke circle, and the North Pole, another on the\\nSouth betweene the Antarctick circle and the South Pole. These of\\nall parts of the earth are worst inhabited, according as\\nextremity of cold is alwaies a greater enemy to mans body, then\\nextremity of heat.\\n\\n3 The third distinction is by the shadowes, which bodies doe cast\\nvpon the earth, iust at nooneday; for these doe not alwaies fall\\none way but diuersly according to their divers scituation vpon\\nthe Earth. Now in respect of the shadowes of mens bodies, the\\ninhabitants of the earth are divided into the\\n\\n1 _Amphiscy_ ([Greek: amphischioi]) whose shadow at noone day\\nfall both waie, so to the North when the Sunne is Southward of\\nthem, & to the South when the Sunne is Northward, and such are\\nthose people that doe dwell in the hot Zone. For the Sunne goes\\nouer their heads twice a yeare, once Northward, another time\\nSouthward, when the Sunne is just ouer their heads they are\\ncalled _Asoy_, [Greek: aschioi], without shadow.\\n\\n2 _Heteroscy_ ([Greek: heteroschioi]) whose shadowes doe alwaies\\nfall one way, namely alwaies towards the North, as those that\\ndwell in the Northerne temperate Zone, or alwaies to the South,\\nas those that dwell in the Southerne temperate Zone.\\n\\n3 _Periscy_ ([Greek: perischioi]) whose shadowes goe round about\\nthem, as those people who dwell in the two cold Zones, for as the\\nSunne never goes downe to them after he is once vp, but alwaies\\nround about, so doe their shadowes.\\n\\n4 The fourth distinction is by the scituation of the Inhabitants\\nof the Earth, compared on with another: who are called either.\\n\\n    1 Perioeci ([Greek: perioichoi]) such as dwell round\\n      about the Earth in one and the same paralell, as for\\n      example vnder the Tropicke of Cancer.\\n\\n    2 Antoeci ([Greek: antoichoi]) such as dwell opposite to\\n      the former in another Paralell of the same distance\\n      from the \\u00c6quator. As those vnder the Tropicke of\\n      Capricorne.\\n\\n    3 Antipodes ([Greek: antipodes]) who dwell iust vnder vs\\n      theire feete opposite to ours.\\n\\n5 The fifth distinction is of the Length and Breadth of the Earth\\nand places vpon it: these may bee considered two wayes\\n\\n    1 Absolutely, and so the\\n      { Longitude or Length of the Earth is its Circuit, and\\n      { Extension from East to west,\\n      {\\n      { Latitude or breadth of it, is the whole Circuit and\\n      { Compasse of it from North to South.\\n\\n    2 Comparatiuely: comparinge one places scituation with\\n      another, and so the\\n      { Longitud of a place, is the distance of it from the\\n      { first Meridian going through the Canary Ilands,\\n      { Eastward. Whereby wee know how farre one place lies\\n      { East or West from another.\\n      {\\n      { Latitude of a place, is the distance of it from the\\n      { \\u00c6quator towards the North or South. Whereby wee know\\n      { how farre one Place lies Northward, or Southward of\\n      { another.\\n\\nThe Longitude must bee reckoned by the degrees of the \\u00c6quator,\\nthe Latitude by the degrees of the Meridian.\\n\\nFor example, in these two H\\u00e6misph\\u00e6res, the longitude of the whole\\nearth is from (_C_) to (_A_) and (_B_) in the \\u00c6quator. The\\nlatitud is from (_N_) to (_S_), and from (_Q_) to (_P_) the North\\nand South poles, and this reckoned in any meridian. The first\\nmeridian is (_ANBS_) which goes by the Canary Ilands, the\\n\\u00c6quinoctiall is (_ABCA_). Now I haue a Citty giuen so. (_D_) I\\nwould know in what longitude and latitude it is. For the\\nlongitude I consider what meridian passeth through it, which is\\nthe meridian (_NDS_) which crosseth the \\u00c6quinoctiall in (_I_) at\\n15 degrees, wherefore I say that (_D_) stands Eastward from the\\nfirst Meridian 15 degrees. So I finde that the Citty (_E_) is 150\\ndegrees Eastward, (_G_) 195, and (_F_) 345.\\n\\nFor the Latitude I consider what paralell runnes through (_DEG_)\\nor (_F_) and I finde the 30 to passe by (_D_) 45 by (_E_) the 15\\nby (_F_) the 45 Southward by (_G_) and those numbers are the\\nlatitude of the place that are distant from the \\u00c6quator, (_CAB_).\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nConcerning the means whereby the longitude of places is found\\nout, there is scarce any thing that hath troubled Mathematicians\\nso much as the observation of it. For because no standing marke\\ncan be taken (the Heavens alwaies running about) it must needs\\nbee difficult. To measure vpon the earth, going alwaies vnder the\\nsame paralell, is a way certain in regard of some few places, but\\nso troublesome in it selfe, and vnprofitable in regard of other\\nplaces that ly out of that paralell, that it may be accounted a\\nfruitlesse labour. The voyages & accounts of Marriners at Sea,\\nare so full of casualty & vncertainty by reason of the doubtfull\\nvariation of the compasse, the vnequall violence of windes and\\ntides, the false making of their sea cards, by which they saile,\\nand the ignorance of the Masters for the greatest part, as there\\ncan hardly be any assured reckoning made by them. The best means\\nof observation is by Eclipses of the Sunne & Moone, which in\\nseverall Countries are sooner or later seene, according as one\\nplace lies farther East or farther West from another. But this\\nalso falls out so seldome, and when it happens, is so seldome\\nobserued, and when it is observed, hath so many difficulties in\\nthe precise and exact observation of it; that wee may Well\\naccount this inquiry after the longitude of places, to be one of\\nthose things whereof wee must be content to be ignorant, & rather\\nto gesse at it in Grosse, then in vaine to striue for exactnesse,\\nwhich is the cause why the tables of the longitude and latitude\\nof Citties, though they many times agree in the latitude, doe yet\\nfor the most part very much differ in the Longitude.\\n\\n6 The sixth Distinction is by the Length or shortnesse of the Day\\nin Summer time in seuerall Quarters of the earth. And this\\ndiuision is by Climates ([Greek: chlimata]) which are seuerall\\nspaces of the earth contained betweene two Paralells, in the\\nwhich the longest day in Summer excedes that in another Paralell\\nby halfe an Houre. There is a greate deale of Confusion and\\ndifference betweene the late and ancient Geographers about the\\ndistinction and diuers reckonings of the Climats. It is not\\nworth the labour to recount theire opinions and Calculations:\\nthus much is plaine, and easie to bee knowne. There are 24.\\nClimats in which the Day encreaseth by halfe houres from 12.\\nhoures to 24. There are likewise 6. Climats in which the day\\nencreaseth by moneths, from one moneth to sixe that is halfe a\\nyeare. Vnder the Aequator the day is alwayes twelue houres longe,\\nbut as you goe from it towards the Pole, the Day lengthens still\\ntill it comes to a day halfe a yeare long.[3] Now in what degrees\\nof latitude euery on of these Climats beginne and end, shall\\nappeare by this table following.\\n\\n[Footnote 3: Those that dwell vnder the Pole haue not past 3, or\\n4 moneths profound as tenebras darke night, for when the Sun is\\nin Libra & Pisces being then nigh, the Horizon it sends forth to\\nthem a glimmering light not vnlike to the twilight or dawning of\\nthe day in a morning a little before the Suns rising _Munster_\\nlib. I. cap.]\\n\\n7 The seaventh and last distinction of the earth is taken from\\nthe scituation of it in respect of the Heavens, and especially\\nthe Sunnes motion.

Either of the\\n    { 1 Whole earth.\\n    {\\n    { 2 Severall parts thereof, and their distance one from\\n    {   another.\\n\\nConcerning the first it is but a needlesse labour to recount the\\ndiversity of opinions that haue beene held from time to time by\\nlearned Geographers. What is the compasse and depth of the earth.\\nThis may be seene in _Hues de vsu Globi, part. 3. cap. 2._ and in\\n_Clavius_ on _Sacrobosco_ with others. They all differ so much\\none from another, that there is no certainty in trusting any of\\nthem. The most common and received opinion is that the circuit of\\nthe earth is 21600 miles, reckoning 60 miles for every degree,\\nand then the depth or Diameter of the Earth shall be 6877 English\\nmiles, containing 5000 foote in a mile.\\n\\nThe means wherby the circuit and Diameter of the earth are found\\nout are principally two.\\n\\n1 By measuring North or South, vnder one Meridian some good\\nquantity of ground, threescore or an hundred miles (or two for\\nthe more certainty) for in those petty observations of small\\ndistances there can be no certaine working. This may be done,\\nthough it be laborious, yet exactly without any sensible error by\\na skilfull workeman, plotting it out vpon his paper, with due\\nheed taken, that hee often rectifie the variation of the needle\\n(by which he travells) vpon due observation, and that all notable\\nascents and descents, with such winding and turning as the\\nnecessity of the way causeth, be reduced to one streight line. By\\nthis means wee shall know how many miles in the Earth answering\\nto a degree in the Heauens; if exact observation by large\\ninstruments be made to finde the elevation of the pole, in the\\nfirst place where wee begin to measure, and the last where wee\\nmake an end.\\n\\nBesides this way of measuring the circumference of the Earth,\\nthere is none other that hath any certainty of observati[~o] in\\nit. That by Eclipses is most vncertain, for a little error in a\\nfew minuts of time (which the observers shall not possibly\\navoide) breeds a sensible and fowle error in the distance of the\\ntwo places of observation. That of _Eratosthenes_ by the Sunne\\nbeames, and a shadow of a stile or gnomon set vpon the Earth, is\\nas bad as the other. For both the vncertainty of the calculation\\nin so small quantity as the shadow and the gnomon must needs\\nhaue, and the difficulty to obserue the true length of the\\nshadow, as also the false supposition wherevpon it proceeds,\\ntaking those lines for Paralells which are not, doe manifestly\\nshew the reckoning hereby made to be doubt full and not sure.\\n\\n2 The second is by measuring the semidiameter of the Earth: For\\nas the circumference makes knowne the diameter, so doth this the\\ncircumference. This may be done by observation made vpon some\\ngreat hill, hard by the sea side. The invention is of _Maurolycus\\nAbbot_ of _Messava_ in _Sicilie_, but it hath beene perfitted,\\nand more exactly performed by a worthy Mathematician _Ed. W._ who\\nhimselfe made proofe of it. By this art was the semidiameter of\\nthe Earth found out to be 18312621 foote: which allowing 5000\\nfoot to a mile is 3662 & a halfe miles, which doubled is the\\nwhole Diameter 7325 miles. The circuit of the earth shall be\\n23030 miles, and one degree containes 63-35/36 miles which is\\nalmost 64 miles. Which as it exceeds the ordinary account, so may\\nwee rest vpon it as more exact then any other.\\n\\n2 The second point concerninge the measuringe of particular\\ndistances of places one from another is thus performed.\\n\\nFirst vpon the Globe it is most easie. With a payre of Compasses\\ntake the distance betweene any two places howsoever scituated\\nvpon the Globe, and apply the distance so taken to the \\u00c6quator, &\\nsee how many degrees it takes vp; those degrees turned into miles\\nshew the distance of the two citties on from another.\\n\\nVpon vniuersall mapps theire is a little more difficulty in\\nfinding the distance of places which here must bee considered in\\na threefold difference of scituation:\\n\\n    1 Of Latitude only.\\n\\n    2 Of Longitude only.\\n\\n    3 Of Latitude and Longitude together.\\n\\n1 If the two places differ only in Latitude, and lie vnder the\\nsame Meridian if the places lie both on one side of the \\u00c6quator,\\nthe differences of the latitudes: or the summe of both latitudes\\nadded together, if one place lie North and another South, being\\nturned into Miles giues the true distance.\\n\\n2 If the places differ only in Longitude, and lie both vnder one\\nparalell of latitude the difference of longitude turned into\\nmiles proportionably accordinge to the latitude of the paralell,\\ngiues the true distance.\\n\\n3 The distance of places differing both in latitude and longitude\\nmay thus bee found out, first let there bee drawne a semicircle\\nvpon a right diameter noted with (_ABCD_) whereof (_D_) shall bee\\nthe Center. The greater this Semi-circle is made, so much the\\nmore easie will bee the operation; because the degrees will bee\\nlarger. Then this Semicircle being drawne, and accordingly\\ndevided, imagine that by the helpe of it, you desire to find out\\nthe distance betwixt London and Ierusalem, which Citties are\\nknowne to differ both in longitude & latitude. Now, that the true\\ndistance betwixt these two places may be found out, you must\\nfirst substract the lesser longitude out of the greater, so shall\\nyou find the differences of their longitudes, which is 47.\\ndegrees. Then reckon that difference vp[~o] the Semi-circle,\\nbeginning at (_A_) & so proceed to (_B_;) & at the end of that\\ndifference, make a marke with the leter (_E_) vnto which point by\\nyour ruler, let a right line be drawne from (_D_) the center of\\nthe Semi circle. This being in this sort performed, let the\\nlesser latitude be sought out which in 32 degrees, in the fore\\nsaid semicircle, beginning your accompt from the point (_E_) and\\nso proceede towards (_B_), and at the end of the lesser latitude\\nlet another point be marked out with the letter (_G_), from which\\npoint, let there be drawen a perpendicular line which may fall\\nwith right Angles vpon the former line drawen from (_D_) to\\n(_E_), and where it chanceth to fall, there marke out a point\\nwith the letter (_H_): This being performed let the greater\\nlatitude which is 51 degrees 32 minuts, be sought out in the\\nsemicircle beginning to reckon from (_A_) towards (_B_) and at\\nthe end of that latitude set another point signed out by the\\nletter (_I_) from whence let there be drawen another\\nperpendicular line that may fall with right angles vpon the\\ndiameter (_AC_): & here marke out a point with the letter (_K_),\\nthis done take with your compasse the distance betwixt (_K_) and\\n(_H_) which distance you must set downe vpon the diameter (_AC_)\\nplaceing the one foot of your compasse vpon (_K_) and the other\\ntowards the center (_D_) and there marke out a point with the\\nletter (_L_); then with your compasse take the shorter\\nperpendicular line (_GH_,) and apply that widenesse vpon the\\nlonger perpendicular line (_IK_,) placing the one foote of your\\ncompasse at (_I_,) which is the bounds of the greater latitude,\\nand extend the other towards (_K_), and there make a point at\\n(_M_), then with your compasse take the distance betwixt (_L_)\\nand (_M_), and apply the same to the semicircle. Placing the one\\nfoot of your compasse in (_A_) and the other towards (_B_), &\\nthere marke out a point with the letter (_N_), now the number of\\ndegrees comprehended betwixt (_A_) and (_N_) will expresse the\\ntrue distance of the two places, which will bee found to be 39\\ndegrees: which being multiplied by 60. and so converted into\\nmiles according to the former rules, will produce 2340. which is\\nthe distance of the said places.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFINIS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Briefe Introduction to Geography\\nby William  Pemble\\n\\n\",\n          \"Produced by Jonathan Ingram, L Barber and PG Distributed Proofreaders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCRESCENT AND IRON CROSS\\n\\n\\nBY E.F. BENSON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Preface_\\n\\n\\nIn compiling the following pages I have had access to certain sources of\\nofficial information, the nature of which I am not at liberty to specify\\nfurther. I have used these freely in such chapters of this book as deal\\nwith recent and contemporary events in Turkey or in Germany in\\nconnection with Turkey: the chapter, for instance, entitled 'Deutschland\\nueber Allah,' is based very largely on such documents. I have tried to be\\ndiscriminating in their use, and have not, as far as I am aware, stated\\nanything derived from them as a fact, for which I had not found\\ncorroborative evidence. With regard to the Armenian massacres I have\\ndrawn largely on the testimony collected by Lord Bryce, on that brought\\nforward by Mr. Arnold J. Toynbee in his pamphlet _The Murder of a\\nNation_, and _The Murderous Tyranny of the Turks,_ and on the pamphlet\\nby Dr. Martin Niepage, called _The Horrors of Aleppo_. In the first\\nchapter I have based the short historical survey on the contribution of\\nMr. D.G. Hogarth to _The Balkans_ (Clarendon Press, 1915). The chapter\\ncalled 'Thy Kingdom is Divided' is in no respect at all an official\\nutterance, and merely represents the individual opinions and surmises of\\nthe author. It has, however, the official basis that the Allies have\\npledged themselves to remove the power of the Turk from Constantinople,\\nand to remove out of the power of the Turk the alien peoples who have\\ntoo long already been subject to his murderous rule. I have, in fact,\\nbut attempted to conjecture in what kind of manner that promise will be\\nfulfilled.\\n\\nFresh items of news respecting internal conditions in Turkey are\\ncontinually coming in, and if one waited for them all, one would have to\\nwait to the end of the war before beginning to write at all on this\\nsubject. But since such usefulness as this book may possibly have is\\ninvolved with the necessity of its appearance before the end of the war,\\nI set a term to the gathering of material, and, with the exception of\\ntwo or three notes inserted later, ceased to collect it after June 1917.\\nBut up to then anything that should have been inserted in surveys and\\narguments, and is not, constitutes a culpable omission on my part.\\n\\nE.F.

Very often his phrase is\\napplicable for the moment and for the situation in view of which he\\ncoined it, but his coin has only a temporary validity: it is good for a\\nmonth or for a year, or for whatever period during which the crisis\\nlasts, and after that it lapses again into a mere token, a thing without\\nvalue and without meaning. But the phrase cannot, as in the case of a\\nmonetary coinage, at once be recalled, for it has gone broadcast over\\nthe land, or, at any rate, it is not recalled, and it goes on being\\npassed from hand to hand, its image and superscription defaced by wear,\\nlong after it has ceased to represent anything. In itself it is\\nobsolete, but people still trade with it, and think it represents what\\nit represented when it came hot from the Mint. And, unfortunately, it\\nsometimes happens that it is worse than valueless; it becomes a forgery\\n(which it may not have been when it came into circulation), and deceives\\nthose who traffic with it, flattering them with an unfounded possession.\\n\\nSuch a phrase, which still holds currency, was once coined by Lord\\nAberdeen in the period of the Crimean War. 'Turkey is a sick man,' he\\nsaid, and added something which gave great offence then about the\\nadvisability of putting Turkey out of his misery. I do not pretend to\\nquote correctly, but that was the gist of it. Nor do I challenge the\\ntruth of Lord Aberdeen's phrase at the period when he made it. It\\npossibly contained a temporary truth, a valid point of view, which, if\\nit had been acted on, might have saved a great deal of trouble\\nafterwards, but it missed then, and more than misses now, the essential\\nand salient truth about Turkey. The phrase, unfortunately, still\\ncontinued to obtain credit, and nowadays it is a forgery; it rings\\nfalse.\\n\\nFor at whatever period we regard Turkey, and try to define that\\nmonstrous phenomenon, we can make a far truer phrase than Lord\\nAberdeen's. For Turkey is not a sick man: Turkey is a sickness. He is\\nnot sick, nor ever has been, for he is the cancer itself, the devouring\\ntumour that for centuries has fed on living tissue, absorbing it and\\nkilling it. It has never had life in itself, except in so far that the\\npower of preying on and destroying life constitutes life, and such a\\npower, after all, we are accustomed to call not life, but death. Turkey,\\nlike death, continues to exist and to dominate, through its function of\\nkilling. Life cannot kill, it is disease and death that kill, and from\\nthe moment that Turkey passed from being a nomadic tribe moving\\nwestwards from the confines of Persia, it has existed only and thrived\\non a process of absorption and of murder. When first the Turks came out\\nof their Eastern fastnesses they absorbed; when they grew more or less\\nsettled, and by degrees the power of mere absorption, as by some failure\\nof digestion, left them, they killed. They became a huge tumour, that\\nnourished itself by killing the living tissues that came in contact\\nwith it. Now, by the amazing irony of fate, who weaves stranger dramas\\nthan could ever be set on censored stages, for they both take hundreds\\nof years to unravel themselves, and are of the most unedifying\\ncharacter, Turkey, the rodent cancer, has been infected by another with\\ngreater organisation for devouring; the disease of Ottomanism is\\nthreatened by a more deadly hungerer, and Prussianism has inserted its\\ncrab-pincers into the cancer that came out of Asia. Those claws are\\nalready deeply set, and the problem for civilised nations is first to\\ndisentangle the nippers that are cancer in a cancer, and next to deprive\\nof all power over alien peoples the domination that has already been\\nallowed to exist too long.\\n\\nThe object of this book is the statement of the case on which all\\ndefenders of liberty base their prosecution against Turkey itself, and\\nagainst the Power that to-day has Turkey in its grip.\\n\\nHistorical surveys are apt to be tedious, but in order to understand at\\nall adequately the case against Turkey as a ruler and controller of\\nsubject peoples, it is necessary to go, though briefly, into her\\nblood-stained genealogy. There is no need to enter into ethnological\\ndiscussions as to earlier history, or define the difference between the\\nOsmanli Turks and those who were spread over Asia Minor before the\\nadvent of the Osmanlis from the East. But it was the Osmanlis who were\\nthe cancerous and devouring nation, and it is they who to-day rule over\\na vast territory (subject to Germany) of peoples alien to them by\\nreligion and blood and all the instincts common to civilised folk. Until\\nGermany, 'deep patient Germany,' suddenly hoisted her colours as a\\nchampion of murder and rapine and barbarism, she the mother of art and\\nliterature and science, there was nothing in Europe that could compare\\nwith the anachronism of Turkey being there at all. Then, in August 1914,\\nthere was hoisted the German flag, superimposed with skulls and\\ncross-bones, and all the insignia of piracy and highway robbery on land\\nand on sea, and Germany showed herself an anachronism worthy to impale\\nher arms on the shield of the most execrable domination that has ever\\noppressed the world since the time when the Huns under Attila raged like\\na forest fire across the cultivated fields of European civilisation.\\nTo-day, in the name of Kultur, a similar invasion has broken on shores\\nthat seemed secure, and it is no wonder that it has found its most\\nvaluable victim and ally in the Power that adopted the same methods of\\nabsorption and extermination centuries before the Hohenzollerns ever\\nstarted on their career of highway robbery. But like seeks like, and\\nperhaps it was not wholly the fault of our astonishing diplomacy in\\nConstantinople that Turkey, wooed like some desirable maiden, cast in\\nher lot with the Power that by instinct and tradition most resembled\\nher. Spiritual blood, no less than physical blood, is thicker than\\nwater, and Gott and Allah, hand-in-hand, pledged each other in the cups\\nthey had filled with the blood that poured from the wine-presses of\\nBelgium and of Armenia.\\n\\nFor centuries before the Osmanli Turks made their appearance in Asia\\nMinor, there had come from out of the misty East numerous bodies of\\nTurks, pushing westwards, and spreading over the Euphrates valley and\\nover Persia, in nomadic or military colonisations, and it is not until\\nthe thirteenth century that we find the Osmanli Turks, who give their\\nname to that congregation of races known as the Ottoman Empire,\\nestablished in the north-west corner of Asia Minor. Like all previous\\nTurkish immigrations, they came not in any overwhelming horde, with\\nsword in one hand and Koran in the other, but as a small compact body\\nwith a genius for military organisation, and the gift, which they retain\\nto this day, of stalwart fighting. The policy to which they owed their\\ngrowth was absorption, and the people whom they first began to absorb\\nwere Greeks and other Christians, and it was to a Christian girl,\\nNilufer, that Osman married his son Orkhan. They took Christian youths\\nfrom the families of Greek dwellers, forced them to apostatise, gave\\nthem military training, and married them to Turkish girls. It was out of\\nthis blend of Greek and Turkish blood, as Mr. D.G. Hogarth points out,\\nthat they derived their national being and their national strength. This\\nsystem of recruiting they steadily pursued not only among the Christian\\npeoples with whom they came in contact, but among the settlements of\\nTurks who had preceded them in this process of pushing westwards, and\\nformed out of them the professional soldiery known as Janissaries. They\\ndid not fight for themselves alone, but as mercenaries lent their arms\\nto other peoples, Moslem and Christian alike, who would hire their\\nservices. This was a policy that paid well, for, after having delivered\\nsome settlement from the depredations of an inconvenient neighbour, and\\nwith their pay in their pocket, they sometimes turned on those who had\\nhired their arms, took their toll of youths, and finally incorporated\\nthem in their growing empire. Like an insatiable sponge, they mopped up\\nthe sprinklings of disconnected peoples over the fruitful floor of Asia\\nMinor, and swelled and prospered. But as yet the extermination of these\\nwas not part of their programme: they absorbed the strength and manhood\\nof their annexations into their own soldiery, and came back for more.\\nThey did not levy those taxes paid in the persons of soldiers for their\\narmies from their co-religionists, since Islam may not fight against\\nIslam, but by means of peaceful penetration (a policy long since\\nabandoned) they united scattered settlements of Turks to themselves by\\nmarriages and the bond of a common tongue and religion.\\n\\nTheir expansion into Europe began in the middle of the fourteenth\\ncentury, when, as mercenaries, they fought against the Serbs, and fifty\\nyears later they had a firm hold over Bulgaria as well. Greece was their\\nnext prey; they penetrated Bosnia and Macedonia, and in 1453 attacked\\nand took Constantinople under Mohammed the Conqueror. Still true to the\\npolicy of incorporation they continued to mop up the remainder of the\\nBalkan Peninsula, and at the same time consolidated themselves further\\nin Asia Minor. By the beginning of the seventeenth century their\\nexpansion reached its utmost geographical limits, but already the Empire\\nheld within it the seeds of its own decay, and by a curious irony the\\nforce that should still keep it together was derived not from its own\\nstrength, but from the jealousies of the European Powers among\\nthemselves, who would willingly have dismembered it, but feared the\\nquarrels that would surely result from the apportionment of its\\nterritories. The Ottoman Empire from then onwards has owed its existence\\nto its enemies.\\n\\nIts weakness lay in itself, for it was very loosely knit together, and\\nno bond, whether of blood or religion or tongue, bound to it the\\nassembly of Christian and Jewish and non-Moslem races of which it was so\\nlargely composed. The Empire never grew (as, for instance, the British\\nEmpire grew) by the emigration and settlement of the Osmanli stock in\\nthe territories it absorbed: it never gave, it only took. From the\\nbeginning right up to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, it has\\nbeen a military despotism, imposing itself on unwilling and alien tribes\\nwhom it drained of their blood, and then left in neglect until some\\nfurther levy was needed. None of its conquered peoples was ever given a\\nshare in the government; they were left unorganised and, so to speak,\\nundigested elements under the Power which had forced them into\\nsubjection, and one by one the whole of the European peoples included in\\nthat uncemented tyranny have passed from under Turkish control. Turkey\\nin Europe has dwindled to a strip along the Bosporus to the Sea of\\nMarmora and the Dardanelles, Egypt has been lost, Tripoli also, and the\\nonly force that, for the last hundred years has kept alive in Europe the\\nexistence of that monstrous anachronism has been the strange political\\nphenomenon, now happily extinct, called the Balance of Power. No one of\\nthe Great Powers, from fear of the complications that would ensue, could\\nrisk the expulsion of the Turkish Government from Constantinople, and\\nthere all through the nineteenth century it has been maintained lest the\\nKey of the Black Sea, which unlocked the bolts that barred Russia's\\ndevelopment into the Mediterranean, should lead to such a war as we are\\nnow passing through. That policy, for the present, has utterly defeated\\nits own ends, for the key is in the pockets of Prussia. But all through\\nthat century, though the Powers maintained Turkey there, they helped to\\nliberate, or saw liberate themselves, the various Christian kingdoms in\\nEurope over which at the beginning of the eighteenth century Turkey\\nexercised a military despotism. They weakened her in so far as they\\ncould, but they one and all refused to let her die, and above all\\nrefused to give her that stab in the heart which would have been implied\\nin her expulsion from Constantinople.\\n\\nFor centuries from the first appearance of the Osmanlis in north-west\\nAsia Minor down to the reign of Abdul Hamid, the Empire maintained\\nitself, with alternate bouts of vigour and relapses, on the general\\nprinciple of drawing its strength from its subject peoples. Internally,\\nfrom whatever standpoint we view it, whether educational, economic, or\\nindustrial, it has had the worst record of any domination known to\\nhistory. Rich in mineral wealth, possessed of lands that were once the\\ngranary of the world, watered by amazing rivers, and with its strategic\\nposition on the Mediterranean that holds the master-key of the Black Sea\\nin its hands, it has remained the most barbaric and least progressive of\\nall states. Its roads and means of communication remained up till the\\nlast quarter of the nineteenth century much as they had been in the days\\nof Osman; except along an insignificant strip of sea-coast railways were\\nnon-existent; it was bankrupt in finance and in morals, and did not\\ncontain a single seed that might ripen into progress or civilisation.\\nMesopotamia was once the most fertile of all lands, capable of\\nsupporting not itself alone, but half the civilised world: nowadays,\\nunder the stewardship of the Turk, it has been suffered to become a\\ndesert for the greater part of the year and an impracticable swamp for\\nthe remainder. Where great cities flourished, where once was reared the\\npride of Babylon and of Nineveh, there huddle the squalid huts of\\nfever-stricken peasants, scarce able to gain their half-starved living\\nfrom the soil that once supported in luxury and pomp the grandeur of\\nmetropolitan cities. The ancient barrages, the canals, the systems of\\nirrigation were all allowed to silt up and become useless; and at the\\nend of the nineteenth century you would not find in all Mesopotamia an\\nagricultural implement that was in any way superior to the ploughs and\\nthe flails of more than two thousand years ago. But so long as there was\\na palace-guard about the gates to secure the safety of the Sultan and\\nhis corrupt military oligarchy, so long as there were houris to divert\\ntheir leisure, tribute of youths to swell their armies, and taxes wrung\\nfrom starving subjects to maintain their pomp, there was not one of\\nthose who held the reins of government who cared the flick of an eyelash\\nfor the needs of the nations on whom the Empire rested, for the\\ncultivation of its soil that would yield a hundredfold to the skilled\\nhusbandman, or for the exploitation and development of its internal\\nwealth. While there was left in the emaciated carcase of the Turkish\\nEmpire enough live tissue for the cancerous Government to grow fat on,\\nit gave not one thought to the welfare of all those races on whom it had\\nfastened itself. Province after province of its European dominions\\nmight be lost to it, but the Balance of Power still kept the Sultan on\\nhis throne, and left the peoples of Asia Minor and Syria at his mercy.\\nThey were largely of alien religion and of alien tongue, and their\\nindividual weakness was his strength. Neglect, and the decay consequent\\non neglect, was the lot of all who languished under that abominable\\ndespotism.\\n\\nWith the accession in 1876 of Abdul Hamid, of cursed memory, there\\ndawned on the doomed subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire a day of\\nbloodier import than any yet. The year before and during that year had\\noccurred the Bulgarian atrocities and massacres, and the word 'massacre'\\nlingered and made music in Abdul Hamid's brain. He said it over to\\nhimself and dwelt upon it, and meditated on the nature and possibilities\\nof massacre. The troubles which massacre had calmed had arisen before\\nhis accession out of the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate, which\\ncorresponded to the Greek Patriarchate, and was given power over\\ndistricts and peoples whom the Greeks justly considered to belong to\\nthem by blood and religion. Greek armed bands came into collision with\\nBulgarian bands, and in order to calm these disturbances by thoroughly\\neffectual means, irregular Turkish troops were sent into Bulgaria,\\ncharged with the command to 'stop the row,' but with no other\\ninstructions. Indiscriminate killing, with all the passions and horrors\\nthat bloodshed evokes in the half-civilised, followed, and there was no\\nmore trouble just then in the disturbed districts, for there was none to\\nmake trouble. In 1876 Abdul Aziz was deposed by a group of king-makers\\nunder Midhat Pasha, Murad V. reigned shadow-like for three months, and\\nduring the same year Abdul Hamid was finally selected to fill the\\nthrone, and stand forth as the Shadow of God. It was a disturbed and\\ntottering inheritance to which he succeeded, riddled with the dry-rot of\\ncorruption, but the inheritor proved himself equal to the occasion.\\n\\nFor a little while he was all abroad, and at the bidding of Midhat, who\\nhad placed him on the throne, he summoned a kind of representative\\nTurkish Parliament, by way of imbuing the Great Powers with the idea\\nthat he was an enlightened Shadow of God bent on reform. This parody of\\na Parliament lasted but a short time: it was no more than a faint,\\ndissolving magic-lantern picture. In the spring of 1877 Rumania, under\\nRussian encouragement, broke away from Turkish rule. Turkey declared war\\non Russia, and in 1878 found herself utterly defeated. At Adrianople was\\ndrawn up the Treaty of San Stefano, creating an independent Bulgarian\\nstate, and, in the opinion of Great Britain and Germany, giving Russia\\nfar greater influence in the Balkan Peninsula than was agreeable to that\\ndisastrous supporter of Turkey, the Balance of Power. In consequence the\\nTreaty of San Stefano was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin.\\n\\nIn those arrangements Abdul Hamid had no voice, but he was well content\\nto sit quiet, think about what was to be done with what was left him,\\nand thank his waning crescent that once again the Balance of Power had\\nsecured Constantinople for him, leaving him free to deal with his\\nAsiatic dominions, and such part of Europe as was left him, as he\\nthought fit. He could safely trust that he would never be ejected from\\nhis throne by a foreign Power, and all he need do was to make himself\\nsafe against internal disturbances and revolutions which might upset\\nhim. And it was then that he begot in the womb of his cold and cunning\\nbrain a policy that was all his own, except in so far as the Bulgarian\\natrocities, consequent on feuds between Bulgars and Greeks, may be\\nconsidered the father of that hideous birth. But it was he who suckled\\nand nourished it, it was from his brain that it emerged, full-grown and\\nin panoply of armour, as from the brain of Olympian Zeus came Pallas\\nAthene. This new policy was in flat contradiction of all the previous\\npolicy, as he had received it from his predecessors, of strengthening\\nTurkey by tributes of man-power from his subject tribes, but it would,\\nhe thought, have the same result of keeping the Turk supreme among the\\nalien elements of the Empire. Times had changed; it behoved him to\\nchange the methods which hitherto had held together his hapless\\ninheritance.\\n\\nNow Abdul Hamid was not in any sense a wise man, and the ability which\\nhas been attributed to him, in view of the manner in which he\\nsuccessfully defied the civilisations of Europe, is based on premisses\\naltogether false. He never really defied Europe at all; he always\\nyielded, secure in his belief that Europe in the shape of the Balance of\\nPower, was unanimous in keeping him where he was. He never even risked\\nbeing turned out of Constantinople, for he knew--none better--that all\\nEurope insisted on retaining him there. As regards wisdom, there was\\nnever a greater fool, but as regards cunning there was never a greater\\nfox. He had a brain that was absolutely impervious to large ideas: the\\nnotion of consolidating and strengthening his Empire by ameliorating its\\ninternal conditions, by bringing it within speaking distance of the\\ninfluence of civilisation and progress, by taking advantage of and\\ndeveloping its immense natural resources, by employing the brains and\\nthe industry of his subject races, seems never to have entered his head.\\nHe could easily have done all this: there was not a Power in Europe that\\nwould not have lent him a helping hand in development and reform, in the\\nestablishment of a solvent state, in aiding the condition of the peoples\\nover whom he ruled. In whatever he did, provided that it furthered the\\nwelfare of his subjects, whether Turk, Armenian, or Arab, the whole\\nConcert of Europe would have provided him with cash, with missionaries,\\nwith engineers, and all the resources of the arts and sciences of peace\\nand of progress. But being a felon, with crime and cunning to take the\\nplace of wisdom, he preferred to develop his Empire on his own original\\nlines. In Europe he was but suffered to exist. There remained Asia.\\n\\nThe policy of previous Osmanli rulers has already been roughly defined.\\nThey strengthened themselves and the military Turkish despotism round\\nthem by absorbing the manhood of the tribes over which they had obtained\\ndominion. Abdul Hamid reversed that policy; he strengthened the Turkish\\nsupremacy, not by drawing into it the manhood of his subject peoples,\\nbut by destroying that manhood. In proportion, so his foxlike brain\\nreasoned, as his alien subjects were weak, so were the Turks strong. A\\nconsistent weakening of alien nations would strengthen the hold of those\\nwho governed the Ottoman Empire. It was as if a man suffered from gout\\nin his foot: he could get rid of the gout by wholesome living, the\\nresult of which would be that his foot ceased to trouble him. But the\\nplan which he adopted was to cause his foot to mortify by process of\\ninhuman savagery. When it was dead it would trouble him no longer.\\n\\nHe was well aware that the Turkish people only comprised some forty per\\ncent, of the population of the Turkish Empire: numerically they were\\nweaker than the alien peoples who composed the rest of it. Something had\\nto be done to bring the governing Power up to such a proportionate\\nstrength as should secure its supremacy, and the most convenient plan\\nwas to weaken the alien elements. The scheme, though yet inchoate, had\\nbeen tried with success in the case of the Bulgarians and Greeks, and to\\ntest it further he stirred up Albanians against the inhabitants of Old\\nServia with gratifying results. They weakened each other, and he further\\nweakened them both by the employment of Turkish troops in Macedonia to\\nquell the disturbances which he had himself fomented. There were\\nmassacres and atrocities, and no more trouble just then from Macedonia.\\nHaving thus tested his plan and found no flaw in it, he settled to adopt\\nit. But European combinations did not really much interest him, for he\\nwas aware that the Great Powers, to whose sacred Balance he owed the\\npermanence of his throne, would not tolerate interference with European\\npeoples, and he turned his attention to Asia Minor. There were\\nexcrescences there which he could not absorb, but which might be\\ndestroyed. He could use the knife on living tissues which the impaired\\ndigestion of the Ottoman Empire could not assimilate. So he hit on this\\nfresh scheme, which his hellish cunning devised with a matchless sense\\nof the adaptation of the means to the end, and he created (though he did\\nnot live to perfect) a new policy that reversed the traditions of five\\nhundred years. That is no light task to undertake, and when we consider\\nthat since his deposition, now nine years ago, that policy has reaped\\nresults undreamed of perhaps by him, we can see how far-sighted his\\ncunning was. To-day it is being followed out by the very combination\\nthat deposed him; his aims have been fully justified, and for that\\nprecise reason we are right to classify him among the abhorred of\\nmankind. He had an opportunity such as is given to the few, and he made\\nthe utmost of it, even as his greater successor on the throne of Turkey\\nfor the present, namely Wilhelm II. of Prussia, has done, in the service\\nof the devil. 'Well done, thou good and faithful servant,' must surely\\nhave been his well-deserved welcome, when he left the hell he had made\\non earth for another.\\n\\nOf all his subjects the Armenians were the most progressive, the most\\nindustrious, the most capable. They therefore contributed, according to\\nthat perverted foxlike mind, one of the greatest menaces to the\\nstability of his throne, which henceforth should owe its strength to the\\nweakness of those it governed. They, as all the world knows, are a\\npeaceful Christian people, and it was against them that Abdul Hamid\\ndirected the policy which he had tested in Europe. The instruments he\\nemployed to put it in force were the Kurds, a turbulent shepherd race\\nmarching with and mixed up among the Armenians. By this means he had the\\nexcuse ready that these massacres were local disturbances among remote\\nand insubordinate tribes, one of whom, however, the Kurds, he armed with\\nmodern rifles and caused to be instructed in some elementary military\\ntraining. Their task was to murder Armenians, their pay was the\\nprivilege to rape their girls and their women, and to rob the houses of\\nthe men they had killed. The Armenians resisted with at first some small\\nsuccess, upon which Abdul Hamid reinforced the Kurds with regular\\ntroops, and caused it to be proclaimed that this was a war of Moslems\\nagainst the infidel, a Holy War. Moslem fanaticism, ever smouldering\\nand ready to burst into flames, blazed high, and a fury of massacres\\nbroke forth against all Armenians, east and west, north and south. The\\nstreets of Constantinople ran with their blood, and before Abdul Hamid\\nwas obliged by foreign civilised Powers to stop those holocausts, he had\\nso decimated the race that not for at least a generation would they\\nconceivably be a menace again even to that zealous guardian of the\\nsupremacy in its own dominions of the Ottoman power. Very unwillingly,\\nwhen obliged to do so, he whistled off his bands of Kurds, and dismissed\\nthem: unwillingly, too, he gave orders that the Armenian hunts which had\\nso pleasantly diverted the sportsmen of Constantinople, must be\\nabandoned: then was decreed a 'close time' for Armenians, the shooting\\nseason was over. There is no exaggeration in this: eye-witnesses have\\nrecorded how at the close of the business day in Constantinople,\\nshooting parties used literally to go out, and beat the coverts of\\ntenement houses for Armenians, of whom there were at that time in\\nConstantinople some 150,000. But when Abdul Hamid had finished his\\nsport, I do not think more than 80,000 at the most survived. These were\\nsaved by the protests of Europe, and perhaps by the knowledge that if\\nall the Armenians were killed, there could never be any more shooting.\\nThe Kurds also had lost a considerable number of men, and that was far\\nfrom displeasing to the yellow-faced butcher of Yildiz. A little\\nblood-letting among those turbulent Kurds was not at all a bad thing.\\n\\nHere, then, we see defined and at work the new Ottoman policy with\\nregard to its peoples. Hitherto, it had been sufficient to take from\\nthem its fill of man-power, and leave the tribe in question to its own\\ndevices. There was no objection whatever to its developing the resources\\nof its territory, to its increasing in prosperity and in population.\\nIndeed the central Power was quite pleased that it should do so, for\\nwhen next the gathering of taxes and youths came round the collectors\\nwould find a creditable harvest awaiting them. Such a tribe received no\\nencouragement or help from the Government; that would have been too\\nmuch to expect, but as long as it kept quiet and obedient it might,\\nwithout interference, prosper as well as it could. But now, in the last\\nquarter of the nineteenth century, all that was changed; instead of a\\npolicy of neglect there was substituted a policy of murder. The state no\\nlonger considered itself secure when in various parts of its dominions\\nits subjects showed themselves progressive and industrious. They had to\\nbe kept down, and clearly the most efficient way of keeping people down\\nwas killing them. Let it not be supposed for a moment that either the\\nfirst massacre, or any that followed, was the result of local\\ndisturbances and fanaticism. It was nothing of the sort: each was\\narranged and planned at Constantinople, as the official means, invented\\nby the arch-butcher, Abdul Hamid, of maintaining in power the most\\ndevilish despotism that has ever disgraced the world. Something had to\\nbe done to prevent the alien tribes in Asia slipping out of the noose of\\nOttoman strangulation, even as the European tribes had done, and\\nforming themselves into separate and independent states. A ruler with\\nprogressive ideas, one who had any perception of the internal prosperity\\nwhich alone can render an empire stable, would have made the attempt to\\nweld his loose and wavering domination together by encouraging and\\nworking for the prosperity of its component peoples, so that he might,\\nthough late in the day, give birth to a Turkey that was strong, because\\nits citizens were prosperous and content. Not so did Abdul Hamid; the\\nTurkey that he sought to establish was merely to be strong because he\\nhad battered into a blood-stained pulp the most progressive and the most\\nindustrious of the alien peoples over whom he ruled.\\n\\nIt is significant that, while yet the blood of the murdered Christians\\nwas scarcely washed from the streets of Constantinople, the Emperor\\nWilhelm II. visited his brother-sovereign at Yildiz, after making his\\ntour throughout the Holy Land. The two can hardly, in their intimate\\nconversations, have completely avoided the subject of the massacres; but\\nafter all, that was not such an unmanageably awkward topic, for Wilhelm\\nII. could tactfully have reminded Abdul Hamid that his own throne also\\nwas based on the murderous progress of the Teutonic Knights. Then there\\nwas the war between Turkey and Greece only lately concluded to discuss,\\nand there again--for the Emperor's sister was Crown Princess of\\nGreece--conversation must have been a shade difficult. Altogether, in\\nspite of the Emperor's lifelong desire to visit the Holy Places in\\nPalestine, it was an odd moment for a Christian monarch to visit the\\nbutcher of Constantinople. But the truth is that Wilhelm II. had a very\\nstrong reason for going to see his brother, for the fruit of German\\npolicy in Turkey was already ripening and swelling on the tree, and the\\nminor disadvantages of visiting this murderous tyrant while still his\\nhands were red with blood was more than compensated for by the\\nadvantages of having a heart-to-heart talk with him on other subjects.\\nGermany had already begun her peaceful penetration, and the real motive\\nof the Emperor's visit was, after swords and orders had been exchanged,\\nto make the definite request that bodies of colonising Germans should be\\nallowed to settle on the Sultan's dominions in Asia Minor, and a hint no\\ndoubt was conveyed that there would be plenty of room for them now that\\nthere were so many Armenian farms unfortunately without a master. But,\\nlike Uriah Heep, the Emperor had attempted to pluck the fruit before it\\nwas ripe, or, to use a more exact simile, before he was tall enough to\\nreach it. In vain he represented to Abdul Hamid the immense advantages\\nwhich would result to Turkey by the establishment of those Gott-like\\nGerman settlers in Asia Minor. Out of his colossal egalo-megalomania, of\\nwhich we know more now, he thought that any request which the\\nAll-Highest should deign to make must instantly be granted. But he met\\nwith a perfectly flat refusal, and the baffled All-Highest left\\nConstantinople in an exceedingly bad temper, which quite undid all the\\ngood that the balm in Gilead and the sacred associations of Jerusalem\\nhad done him. It is pleasant to think of the Pan-Islamic merriment with\\nwhich Abdul Hamid must have viewed the indignant exit of his Christian\\nbrother, who had come such a long way to see him, and was so tactful\\nabout the Armenian atrocities. He might perhaps--for those Christians\\nwere very odd pigs--have expressed horror or remonstrance. Not at all:\\nhe was much too anxious to get his request granted, to make himself\\ndisagreeable. But did his Christian brother really think that all those\\nmassacres over which Abdul Hamid had spent so much time and money, had\\nbeen arranged in order to settle those nasty progressive Germans in the\\nlands that had been so carefully depopulated? Why, the whole point of\\nthem had been that the Armenians were too progressive and prosperous,\\nthus constituting a menace to the central Government, and certainly\\nAbdul Hamid was not meaning to put in their place settlers even more\\nprogressive and with a stronger backing behind them. So off went the\\nAll-Highest back home again, very much vexed with Abdul Hamid, and\\npossibly (if that was not sacrilegious) with himself for having been in\\ntoo great a hurry. There was more spade-work to be done yet before\\nTurkey was ripe for open and avowed colonisation by the Fatherland.\\n\\nThe episode, strictly historical, is of a certain importance, for it\\nshows the date at which Wilhelm II. thought that the time had come for\\nGermans to colonise Turkey. The peaceful penetration (which now amounts\\nto perforation) was even then pretty far advanced. But Abdul Hamid seems\\nto have seen the significance of the request, and for some little while\\nafter that German influence had a certain set-back in Turkey. The date\\nof this marks an era, and Germany, 'deep patient Germany,' set to work\\nagain, in no way discouraged, to set her cancer-nippers in the cancer\\nthat already had begun to eat the live tissues round it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Chapter II_\\n\\n\\nTHE THEORY OF THE NEW TURKS\\n\\nIn the year 1908 a military group in Constantinople, styling itself the\\n'Young Turk' party, seized and deposed Abdul Hamid, and shut him up at\\nSalonika, there to spend the remainder of his infamous days. They put\\nforth a Liberal programme of reformation, one that earned them at the\\nmoment the sympathy of civilised Europe (including Germany), and the\\nBalance of Power very mistakenly and prematurely heaved a sigh of\\nrelief. For upwards of a century it had maintained in Constantinople the\\ncorrupt and bloody autocracy of the Sultans, fearing the European\\nquarrels that would attend the dismemberment of that charnel-house of\\ndecay known as the Ottoman Empire, and now (just for the moment) it\\nseemed as if a sudden rally had come to the Sick Man, and he showed\\nsigns of returning animation and wholesome vitality. The policy of the\\nPowers, after a century of failure, looked as if it was justifying\\nitself, and they were full of congratulations towards Turkey and each\\nother. But never, in the whole century of their pusillanimous cacklings,\\nhad they made a greater mistake.\\n\\nWhether the Young Turks ever meant well or not, whether there was or was\\nnot a grain of sincerity in this profession of their policy, is a\\ndisputed question. There are those who say that originally they were\\nprompted by patriotic and high-minded aims, when they proclaimed their\\nobject of 'Organisation,' and of reform. But all are agreed that it\\nmatters very little what their original aims were, so speedily did their\\nLiberal intentions narrow down to an Ottomanisation such as Adbul Hamid\\nhad aimed at, but had been unable to accomplish before his evil sceptre\\nceased to sway the destinies of his kingdom. In any case this programme\\nearned its authors the sympathy of Europe, and probably this, and no\\nmore than this, prompted it. They wished to establish themselves,\\nunquestioned and undisturbed, and did so; and I do not think we shall\\nbe far wrong if we take the original Young Turk programme about as\\nseriously as we took the parody of a Parliament with which Abdul Hamid\\nopened (as with a blessing) his atrocious reign. The very next year\\n(1909) they permitted (if they did not arrange) the Armenian massacres\\nat Adana, and the Balance of Power began faintly to wonder whether the\\nYoung Turks in their deposition of Abdul Hamid had not slain an asp and\\nhatched a cockatrice. Given that their aims originally were sincere, we\\ncan but marvel at the swiftness of the corruption which in little more\\nthan a year had begun to lead them not into paths of reform and Liberal\\npolicy, but along the road towards which the butcher they had deposed\\nhad pointed the way. It must have made Abdul Hamid gnaw his nails and\\nshake impotent hands to see those who had torn him from his throne so\\nsoon pursuing the very policy which he invented, and to which he\\nnominally owed his dethronement. Strange, too, was it that his overthrow\\nshould come from the very quarter to which he looked for security, for\\nit was on the army that each Sultan in turn had most relied for the\\nstability of his throne. But Abdul Hamid, in order, perhaps, to deal\\nmore effectually with the subject races he wished to exterminate, had\\nintroduced a system of foreign training for the officers of his army, a\\ncourse of Potsdam efficiency, and it was just they, on whom Sultans from\\ntime immemorial had relied, who knocked the prop of the army away from\\nhim. Though publicly, for the edification of Europe his deposers\\nprofessed a Liberal policy, it was not on account of Armenian massacres\\nthat they turned him off his throne, but because of the muddle and\\ncorruption and debility of his rule. Herein we may easily trace the hand\\nof Germany, no longer publicly beckoning as when Wilhelm II., just after\\nthe first Armenian massacres, made his request of the Sultan for the\\nestablishment in Turkey of German colonists, but working underground,\\nsapping and mining like a mole. For Germany, her mind already fixed on\\nsecuring Turkey as an instrument of her Eastern policy, wanted a strong\\nTurkey, and without doubt desired to bring an end to the disorganisation\\nand decay of the Empire, and create and at the same time interpenetrate\\nan efficient state that should be useful to her. We may take it for\\ngranted that she, like the rest of Europe, welcomed any sign of\\nregeneration in the Ottoman Empire, but there was an ulterior purpose\\nbehind that. Turkey, already grasped by the Prussian hand, must be in\\nthat hand a weapon fit for use, a blade on which she could rely. She\\nstrengthened the Turkish army by the introduction of Prussian\\ndiscipline, and worked on good material. Already she has realised her\\nambition in this respect, and now controls the material which she then\\nworked on.\\n\\nThe troubled years of the Balkan wars which followed this false dawn,\\ncoupled with the loss of all the territory which remained to the Ottoman\\nEmpire in Europe, with the exception of Thrace, caused an immediate\\nreaction from the open-minded policy of the Young Turks, if we decide to\\ncredit them at the outset with a sincere purpose. Organisation by a\\nslightly different spelling became Ottomanisation, and the aims of the\\nYoung Turks were identified with those of the Nationalist party which\\nfollowed out and developed into a finished and super-fiendish policy the\\ndreams of Abdul Hamid. He, as we have seen, had invented the idea of\\nsecuring Ottoman supremacy in the Empire, not as before by absorption of\\nthe strength of its subject peoples, but by their extermination, and\\nthis formed part of the new programme which was to be more efficiently\\nadministered. Already, in 1909, the experimental massacre at Adana took\\nplace, and the Young Turk party, with its possibly Liberal aims, had\\nbecome a party that had as its main object a system of tyranny and\\nmurder such as the world had never seen. Simultaneously Turkey itself,\\nNationalist party and all, became enslaved to German influence. Link by\\nlink the chains were forged and the manacles welded on, and before the\\nEuropean War broke out in 1914, the incarceration of Turkey in Germany\\nwas complete, and Wilhelm II. had a fine revenge for the snub inflicted\\non him by Abdul Hamid when he proposed the scheme of German\\ncolonisation in the lands depopulated by the Armenian massacres of 1895.\\n\\nFrom the first the aim of the Nationalists, who thus formed so deadly a\\nblend with the Young Turk party, was Ottomanisation, or the\\nestablishment within the Empire of an Ottoman domination which should be\\npure and undefiled, and in which none of the subject peoples, be they\\nArmenians or Kurds, Arabs or Greeks or Jews, Christian or Moslem, should\\nhave any part. The inception of the scheme was no doubt inspired by the\\nexample given by Prussia's treatment of the Poles, and Hungary's of\\nRoumans and Slovaks. But in thoroughness of method Prussia's pupil was\\nto prove Prussia's master, for it aimed not merely at expropriation, but\\nextermination, and sought to become strong, not merely by weakening\\nalien elements, but by abolishing them. It did not set this out quite\\nexplicitly in its manifestoes and the resolutions of its congresses, but\\ntwo extracts, the first from the proceedings of the 'Committee of Union\\nand Progress,' held in Constantinople in 1911, have a sinister\\nsuggestiveness about them for which the acts and measures of the\\nCommittee had already supplied the comment.\\n\\n'The formation of new parties in the Chamber or in the country must be\\nsuppressed, and the emergence of new Liberal ideas prevented. Turkey\\nmust become a really Mohammedan country, and Moslem influence must be\\npreponderant. Every other religious propaganda must be suppressed....\\nSooner or later the complete Ottomanisation of all Turkish subjects must\\nbe effected; it is clear, however, that this can never be attained by\\npersuasion, but that we must resort to armed force.... Other\\nnationalities must be denied the right of organisation, for\\ndecentralisation and autonomy are treason to the Turkish Empire.'\\n\\nCould there be a completer reversion to the policy of Abdul Hamid, than\\nthis formal resolution, passed within three years of the time when the\\nYoung Turks deposed him? The conviction begins to dawn on one--as it\\nbegan to dawn on the Balancers of Power--that he owed his downfall not\\nto his illiberal and butcherous policy, but because he was not thorough\\nenough.\\n\\nThe second extract, from a pamphlet by Jelal Noury Bey, may be added,\\nwhich defines the policy, not with regard to the Christian or Jewish\\nsubjects of the Turks, but with regard to the Arabs, Moslem by creed,\\nand the guardians of the Holy Cities.\\n\\n'It is a peculiarly imperious necessity of our existence for us to\\nTurkise the Arab lands, for the particularistic idea of nationality is\\nawaking among the younger generation of Arabs, and already threatens us\\nwith a great catastrophe. Against this we must be fore-armed.'\\n\\nThe design of Ottomanisation soon began to take practical form.\\nOttomanisation was to be the highest expression of patriotism, and any\\nmeans which secured it, massacres such as, in 1909, had taken place at\\nAdana, or the treatment accorded to the Greeks and Bulgarians who\\nremained in Thrace after the Balkan wars, were in accordance with the\\nnew 'Liberal' gospel. Thrace was the only territory left to the Turks in\\nEurope, and as it was largely populated by Greeks and Bulgarians, it\\ncould not be considered as sufficiently Ottomanised. A massacre under\\nthe very eyes of Europe was perhaps dangerous, so it sufficed to put the\\nentire non-Turkish population over the frontier and lay hands on their\\nproperty. In fact this was the first of the 'deportation' schemes which,\\nin 1915, proved so successful with the Armenians, and the effect of it\\nwas that neither Greeks nor Bulgarians were left in Thrace. Then\\nfollowed the expulsion of Greeks from the Mediterranean sea-board, but\\nthis was never completely carried out because the European war\\nintervened, and the attention of the Nationalists was claimed by their\\nover-lord. Later, as we shall see, a further deportation of Greeks was\\nbegun, but again that was stopped, for Germany saw that it would never\\ndo to have her Turkish allies murdering settlers of the same blood as\\nthose she hoped would become her allies. Of course, when it was only a\\nquestion of Armenians she did not interfere.\\n\\nThe design, then, of the new 'Liberal' regime, of which those three\\nmeasures, the massacres at Adana, the expulsion of Greeks and Bulgarians\\nfrom Thrace, and of Greeks from the sea-board of the Mediterranean, were\\nearly instances, was to restore the absolute supremacy of the Turks in\\nthe Ottoman Empire. It was obvious that the problem was one of\\nconsiderable difficulty, since the Turks at the time composed only some\\nforty per cent, of the whole population. They numbered about 8,000,000,\\nwhile in the Empire were included about 7,000,000 Arabs, 2,000,000\\nGreeks, 2,000,000 Armenians, and 3,000,000 more of smaller\\nnationalities, such as Kurds, Druses, and Jews. But the Turks were\\nbacked by Germany, and nowadays, since the abolition of the\\nCapitulations, which leaves all alien races unprotected by foreign\\nPowers, such as survive, after the extermination of the Armenians, are\\ncompletely at the mercy of the Government in Constantinople. All these\\npeoples speak a different language from the Turks, and have a different\\nreligion, for the Nationalist party, with a view to the Ottomanisation\\nof the Arabs, have definitely stated that Arab Moslems are not of the\\ntrue faith, and that their own Allah (in whose name they subsequently\\nexterminated the Armenians) is the God of Love--German equivalent\\nGot--whereas the Arab Allah is the God of vengeance. The sinister motive\\nin this discovery needs no comment, for it is obvious that it releases\\nthe Ottoman Government from the prohibition in the Koran, whereby Moslem\\nmay not fight against Moslem. Therefore the Arabs were declared not to\\nbe true Moslems. Later on, that motive was translated into practical\\nmeasures.\\n\\nAmong the first tasks with regard to the Arabs that faced the\\nNationalist party from what we may call the pacific side of their\\nmission was to substitute the Turkish language for Arabic. Kemal Bey, a\\nNationalist of Salonika, with the help of Ziya Bey, collected round him\\na group of young writers, and these proceeded to translate the Koran out\\nof Arabic into Turkish, and to publish the prayers for the Caliphate in\\ntheir own language, and orders went out that these revised versions\\nshould be used in all mosques. Turkish was to be the official language\\nfor use in all public proclamations, and, with Prussian thoroughness, it\\nwas even substituted on such railway tickets as had hitherto been\\nprinted in Arabic. The new Turkish tongue (Yeni Lisan) had also to be\\npurged of all foreign words, but here some difficulty was experienced,\\nfor Persian and Arabic formed an enormous percentage in the language as\\nhitherto employed, and the promoters of this Ottoman purity of tongue\\nfound themselves left with a very jejune instrument for the rhapsodies\\nof their patriotic aims. Poets in especial (for the Nationalists, like\\nall well-equipped founders of romantic movements, had their bards) found\\nthemselves in sore straits owing to the limited vocabulary; and we read\\nof one, Mehmed Emin Bey, who was forced to publish his odes in small\\nprovincial papers, since no well-established journal would admit so\\nscrannel an expression of views however exalted.[1] But the translation\\nof the Koran was the greatest linguistic feat, and Tekin Alp, the most\\nprominent exponent of Nationalism, refers to it as one of the noblest\\ntasks undertaken by the new movement. It mattered not at all that by\\nreligious ordinance the translation of the Koran into any other tongue\\nwas a sin. 'The Nationalists,' he tells us, 'have cut themselves off\\nfrom the superstitious prejudice.' A further attempt was made to\\nsubstitute Turkish letters for Arabic letters in the alphabet, but this\\nseems to have presented insuperable difficulties, and I gather that it\\nhas been abandoned.\\n\\n[Footnote 1: This thwarted poet retired from the Committee of Union and\\nProgress not long after, and his place was taken by Enver.]\\n\\nThe Ottomanisation of religion and language, then, was among the pacific\\nmethods of spreading Pan-Turkism through the Empire. A monstrous idol\\nwas set up, a Hindenburg idol, in front of which all peoples and\\nlanguages, not Christians alone, but Moslems, were bound to prostrate\\nthemselves. Indeed it was against Arabs mainly that these provisions\\nwere directed, for the Arabs constituted the most menacing obstacle to\\nthe spread of Ottomanisation, since they numbered in the Empire only a\\nmillion less than the Turks themselves. It was ordained by statute that\\nno Arab could have a seat on the Committee of Union and Progress, and\\nthe Cabinet similarly was purged of any Greek or Armenian element. Never\\nany more must there be new parties in the Chamber, never any more must\\nLiberal ideas (to champion which the New Turk party had come into being)\\nbe allowed to prick up their pernicious heads. For the Nationalist\\nparty, with whom the New Turks were now identical, had taken as their\\ncreed all that the deposed Abdul Hamid stood for, and only differed from\\nhim in that as their schemes developed they looked forward to logical\\nconclusions far beyond what he had ever dreamed of. But Abdul Hamid may,\\nI think, be taken to be the true founder of the new Nationalism: at any\\nrate it was he who had first seen the possibilities of massacre as a\\nmeans of maintaining Ottoman supremacy. In the hands of Nationalists\\nthat was to prove a more effective weapon than the printing of railway\\ntickets in Turkish. But already before the European War the Nationalists\\nhad vastly extended his ideas, and had seen the danger of allowing even\\nArabs to have a standing of any kind in the new state. Henceforth all\\nsubject people were to be _rayas_, cattle, as in the old days of the\\nSultans who absorbed the strength of the aliens, but did not exterminate\\nthem. But now the cattle were not only to be used for milk, but were to\\nbe slaughtered when advisable. Till then they must be dumb, or speak the\\nlanguage of their masters only, for this alone can save them from the\\nshambles. Ahmed Sherif Bey, a prominent Nationalist, lays this down. 'It\\nis the business of the Porte to make the Arabs forget their own\\nlanguage, and to impose upon them instead that of the nation that rules\\nthem. If the Porte loses sight of this duty, it will be digging its\\ngrave with its own hands, for if the Arabs do not forget their language,\\ntheir history, and their customs, they will seek to restore their\\nancient empire on the ruins of Ottomanism and of Turkish rule in Asia.'\\n\\nHere, then, is the definite statement of the Nationalists' hostility to\\nall things Arab, and we shall see how they translated it into practice.\\nEven Moslems were but cattle for them, as also were Armenians and Greeks\\nand Kurds. Armenians were doomed to be the first complete sacrifice on\\nthe bloody altar of the Nationalists, and, as a Turkish gendarme engaged\\nin that sacrifice said to a Danish Red Cross nurse, 'First we kill the\\nArmenians, then the Greeks, and then the Kurds.' And if he had been a\\nProgressive Minister he would certainly have added, 'And then the\\nArabs.'\\n\\nIt was not only within the present limits of the Ottoman Empire that the\\nCommittee of Union and Progress proposed to accomplish their unitive\\npurpose, for after having seen a glorious and exclusive Turkey arise\\nover the depopulated territories of their alien peoples, a vaster\\nvision, for an account of which we are indebted to Tekin Alp, opened\\nbefore their prophetic eyes. Out of the 10,000,000 inhabitants of Persia\\nthey claim that one-third are of true Turkish blood, and in the new\\nTurkey which, so they almost pathetically hope, will be established at\\nthe conclusion of the European War by the help of Wilhelm II., those\\nPersian Turks must be incorporated into the true fold of Allah, God of\\nLove. The province of Adarbaijan, for instance, the richest and most\\nenlightened district of Persia, they claim, is entirely Turkish, and\\nhere the needful rectification will be made in the new atlases that bear\\nthe imprimatur of Potsdam. Similarly, all the country south of the\\nCaucasus must rank as Turkish territory, since the Turks form from fifty\\nto eighty per cent, of the population; all Kazan, for the same reason,\\nis truly Turkish, with the alluvial plains of the Volga, while the\\nCrimea, so Tekin Alp discovers, is also a lost sheep longing for the\\nTurkish fold. All this is Turkey (or Turania) Irredenta, and, may we not\\nadd:--\\n\\n'Jerusalem and Madagascar\\nAnd North and South Amerikee.'\\n\\nAnd then what a glorious future awaits the Power that Europe once\\nthought of as a sick man. 'With the crushing of Russian despotism,'\\nexclaims Tekin Alp, 'by the brave German, Austrian, and Turkish armies,\\nthirty to forty million Turks will receive their independence. With the\\nten million Ottoman Turks this will form a nation of fifty millions,\\nadvancing towards a great civilisation which may perhaps be compared to\\nthat of Germany, in that it will have the strength and energy to rise\\neven higher. In some ways it will be even superior to the degenerate\\nFrench and English civilisations.'\\n\\nThe arithmetic and the enthusiasm of the foregoing paragraph are, of\\ncourse, those of Tekin Alp, from whose book, _The Turkish and\\nPan-Turkish Ideal_, the quotation is made. The work was published in\\n1915, and, appearing as it did after the beginning of the European War,\\nit is but natural to find in it an expression not only of the\\nNationalist aims for Turkey, but of the Prussian aims for Turkey, or, to\\nspeak more correctly, of the dream which Prussia has induced in a\\nhypnotised Turkey. It sets forth in fact the bait which Prussia has\\ndangled in front of Turkey, the hunger for which has inspired the\\nprojected future which is here sketched out; and significantly enough\\nthis book has been spread broadcast over Turkey by the agency of German\\npropagandists. The Ottomanisation of the Empire, the vision of its\\nfurther extension, free from all consideration of subject peoples, was\\nexactly the lure which was most likely to keep the Turks staunch to\\ntheir Prussian masters. It will be noticed that there is no suggestion\\nof the Turks recovering their lost provinces and kingdoms in Europe,\\nGreece, Bulgaria, Rumania, Servia, and the rest, for it would never do\\nto let Fox Ferdinand awake from _his_ hypnotic sleep of a sort of\\nCzardom over the Balkans, or cease to dangle dreams, that included even\\nConstantinople before the shifty eye of King Constantine So, before\\nTurkey was spread the prospect of appropriating Russian and Persian\\nspoils: Prussia had already given the lost Turkish kingdoms in Europe\\nelsewhere, but would there not be a dismembered Russian Empire to\\ndispose of? The Crimea, the province of Kazan, the province of\\nTrans-Caucasia: all these might be held before Turkey's nose, as a dog\\nhas a piece of meat held up before it to make it beg. Then there was the\\nprovince of Adarbaijan: certainly Turkey might be permitted to promise\\nherself that, without incurring the jealousy of Austria or Bulgaria.\\nGreedily Turkey took the bait. She gulped it down whole, and never\\nconsidered that there was a string attached to it, or that, should ever\\nthe time come when Germany, the conqueror of the world, would be in a\\nposition to reward her Allies with the realisation of the dreams she had\\ninduced, the string would be pulled, and up, with retchings and\\nvomitings, would come these succulent morsels of Russia and Persia.\\nIndeed these bright pictures flashed on to the sheet as the visions of\\nNationalists are but the slides in a German magic-lantern, designed to\\nkeep Turkey amused, and it was with the same object that Ernst Marre, in\\nhis _Die Tuerken und Wir nach dem Kriege_, was bidden to make other\\npictures ready in case Turkey grew fractious or sleepy. 'From the ruins\\nof antiquity,' he says, when speaking of the Ottoman Empire, 'new life\\nwill spring, if we can manage to raise the treasures which time and sand\\nhave covered.' Then he remembers that he must be less Pan-Germanic for\\nthe moment, and dangles the bait again. 'In doing this,' he adds, 'we\\nare benefiting Turkey. The Turkish state is no united whole, and it has\\nalways been very difficult to govern. Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Armenians,\\nKurds, cannot be welded together. This is a war of liberation for\\nTurkey.... Only by energetic interference, and by \\\"expelling\\\" the\\nobstinate Armenian element could the Ottoman Empire get rid of a Russian\\ndomination.... The non-Turkish population of the Ottoman Empire must be\\nOttomanised.'\\n\\nThere is no need for further quotations, which might be multiplied\\nindefinitely. The Prussian programme is for the moment identical with\\nthe Turkish Nationalist programme: Turkey, in order to be kept 'in with'\\nGermany, must be encouraged to dream of depopulated Armenia (that dream\\nhas come tragically true) and of annexations in Russia and Persia. All\\nthis fitted in with the Turkish programme: Germany had scarcely to\\ninspire, only to encourage. That encouragement she gave, for,\\nsimultaneously she was penetrating Turkey as water penetrates a sponge,\\nand reducing it to the position of a vassal state. To keep Turkey happy\\nshe allowed the Armenian massacres to run their deadly course, and only\\ninterfered with other massacres when they did not suit her purpose. But\\nsupposing (to suppose the impossible) that a peace to the European War\\nwas dictated by Germany, how much of the future Pan-Turkish programme\\nwould be realised? Would there be a Turkey at all? I think not: there\\nwould be a Germany in Europe, and a Germany in Asia, where Turkey once\\nwas. Indeed, in all but name, they are in existence now; so complete, as\\nwe shall see, has been Germany's penetration of the Ottoman Empire. Just\\nfor the present she calls herself Turkey in those regions; that is her\\nincognito. But Turkey as an independent Power has already ceased to\\nexist, and Tekin Alp and the Nationalists still dream on with rainbow\\nvisions of Ottomanisation, the vistas of which stretch far into Persia\\nand the plains of the Volga. And all the while she has been put out like\\na candle, and all that is left of her is the smouldering wick ready to\\nbe pinched between the horny fingers of her stepmother. There she\\nstands, her stepmother, with her grinning teeth already disclosing the\\nWolf....\\n\\nWhatever the end of the European War may be, in no circumstances can the\\ndreams of the Nationalists be realised. Even if Germany and her arms\\nwere so victorious that Russia lay at her feet a mere inert carcase\\nready for the chopper, she would no more dream of giving Russian\\nprovinces to an independent Turkey than she would hand over to her\\nBerlin itself. And if, as we know, Germany can never be victorious, will\\nthe Allies once more strive to keep the Sick Man alive, or leave in his\\nruthless power the peoples whom he is longing to exterminate? Even Tekin\\nAlp can hardly expect that.\\n\\nHere then, in brief, is the policy of New Turkey. Its subject\\npeoples--Armenians, Arabs, Greeks, Kurds, and Jews--are to be totally\\nunrepresented in its councils, though together they number sixty per\\ncent, of the population of the Empire. But they are not only to be\\nunrepresented in Government--they are, if the programme is to be carried\\nconclusively out, to have no existence. In accordance with the plans of\\nthe murderous ruffians who to-day administer the Nationalist policy,\\nthose of the Armenians who have not fled beyond the frontiers have\\nalready been exterminated, and the same fate threatens Arabs, Greeks,\\nand Jews. Hence, when the Allied Governments wrote their joint note to\\nPresident Wilson, they stated that among their aims in the war was 'the\\nliberation of the peoples who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny of\\nthe Turks.' From that avowed determination they will never recede.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nNOTE.--It is to be hoped that Tekin Alp's pamphlet, _Turks and the\\nPan-Turkish Ideal_, may soon be accessible to English readers. The\\nauthor is a Macedonian Jew who writes under the pseudonym of Tekin Alp,\\nand his mind is such that he appears to find romance in the idea of a\\nunited Turkey purged by indiscriminate massacre from all alien elements.\\nBut he sets forth with admirable lucidity the aims of the Nationalist\\nparty and the steps already achieved by them in their progress towards\\ntheir ideal. Already the sequestered ladies of the harem have come out\\nof their retirement and join in the crusade, and not only do men give\\nlectures to women, but 'women mount the platform and address the men.'\\nThere are corporations to advance economic organisations, boy-scout\\ncentres all over the Empire, and 'intellectual parties' among the guilds\\nof merchants--England and Russia appear as the most virulent foes of\\nPan-Turkism, 'the colossus of darkest barbarism joined with the colossus\\nof a degenerate civilisation.'\\n\\nIn the second part of his pamphlet Tekin Alp passes on with an\\nenthusiasm which is as sincere as it is pathetic to the vision of a\\ntremendous Turkey, extending from Thrace on the west to the Desert of\\nGobi on the east. It embraces, as his map shows, Egypt as far south as\\nVictoria Nyanza, Arabia, Persia, the greater part of India, the littoral\\nof the Black Sea, the plains of the Volga, the circuit of the Caspian\\nSea and the Aral Sea, and in the north-east nearly touches Tomsk. All\\nthis naturally is dependent on complete German victory in the war, and,\\npathetically enough, Tekin Alp appears to think that his ideal Turkey\\nwill meet with the approval of Germany. Indeed it is no wonder that his\\npamphlet is circulated broadcast by German propagandists, for it is\\nprecisely what Germany wants Turkey to believe.\\n\\nThe romance of the movement appeals also very strongly to Ziya Goek Alp,\\nthe official bard of the butchers of Constantinople. He has written a\\nsort of Ode to Attila, quoted by Tekin Alp, which is a fine frenzy in\\nfavour of barbarism. This preposterous poem begins:\\n\\n'I do not read the famous deeds of my ancestors in the dead, faded,\\ndusty leaves of the history books, but in my own veins, in my own heart.\\nMy Attila, my Huns, those heroic figures which stand for the proud fame\\nof my race, appear in those dry pages to our malicious and slanderous\\nage as covered with shame and disgrace, while in reality they are no\\nless than Alexander and Caesar,' etc. etc.\\n\\nI have been at present unable to ascertain whether it is true that the\\nGerman Emperor has set it to music, under the impression that it refers\\nto him and the German armies. It is very popular in Prussia, which need\\narouse no surprise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Chapter III_\\n\\n\\nTHE END OF THE ARMENIAN QUESTION\\n\\nWe have traced in brief the backward progress of Ottoman domination, and\\nhave seen how, from the rough and ready methods of a military barbarism,\\nthe Turks evolved a more emphatic and a more highly organised negation\\nof all those principles which we may sum up under the general term of\\ncivilisation. The comparatively humane neglect of the unfortunate alien\\npeoples herded within the frontiers of earlier Sultans was improved upon\\nby Abdul Hamid, who struck out the swifter and superior methods of\\nmaintaining the dominating strength of the Turkish element in the\\nkingdom not by the absorption of subject peoples, but by their\\nextermination. This in turn, this new and effective idea, served as a\\nfirst sketch of an artist with regard to his finished picture, and\\nstarting with that the Nationalist party enlarged and elaborated it\\ninto that masterpiece of massacre which they exhibited to the world in\\nthe years 1915 and 1916 of the Christian Era, when from end to end of\\nthe Empire there flashed the signal for the extermination of the\\nArmenian race. Abdul Hamid was but tentative and experimental as\\ncompared to their systematised thoroughness, but then the Nationalist\\nparty had learned thoroughness under the tutelage of its Prussian\\nmasters. And in addition to instruction they had had the advantage of\\nseeing how Prussian firmness, with the soothing balm of Kultur to\\nfollow, had dealt with the now-subject remnant of Belgians. That was the\\nway to treat subject people: 'the first care of a state is to protect\\nitself,' as Enver and Talaat could read in the text-books now translated\\ninto Turkish, in copies, maybe, presented to them by their Master in\\nBerlin, and Turkey could best show the proof of her enlightenment and\\nregeneration, by following in the footsteps of Prussian Kultur. Perhaps\\na few thousand innocent men might suffer the inconvenience of having\\ntheir nails torn out, of being bastinadoed to death, of being shot,\\nburned or hanged, perhaps a few thousand girls and women might die by\\nthe wayside in being deported to 'agricultural colonies,' might fall\\nvictims to the lusts of Turkish soldiers, or have babes torn from their\\nwombs, but these paltry individual pains signified nothing compared to\\nthe national duty of 'suffering the state to run no risks.' As one of\\nthis party of Union and Progress said, 'The innocent of to-day may be\\nthe guilty of to-morrow,' and it was therefore wise to provide that for\\ninnocent and guilty alike there should be no to-morrow at all. Years\\nbefore the statesmanship of Abdul Hamid had prophetically foreseen the\\ndawning of this day, when he remarked 'The way to get rid of the\\nArmenian question is to get rid of the Armenians,' and temporarily for\\ntwenty years he did get rid of the Armenian question. But when, in 1915,\\nTalaat Bey completed his arrangements for a further contribution to the\\nsolution of the same problem, he said, 'After this, there will be no\\nArmenian question for fifty years.' As far as we can judge, he rather\\nunder-estimated the thoroughness of his arrangements.[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: Lately (September 1917), when the massacres were all over,\\nTalaat, speaking at a Congress of the Committee of Union and Progress,\\nupheld as right and proper the treatment of the Armenian race.]\\n\\nThe race thus marked out for extermination was one of the oldest\\nsettlements in Asiatic Turkey. Originally it was confined to Armenia\\nproper, a highland district comprising part of what is now the Russian\\nprovince of Trans-Caucasia, part of Persia, notably the province of\\nAdarbaijan, and, within the Turkish frontier, the province of Armenia,\\nitself. According to legend, which may well be correct, the Armenians\\nwere the oldest national Christian Church in the world, with a liturgy\\nthat dates from the first century of the Christian Era, while their\\ntranslation of the Bible dates from the early years of the fifth century\\nA.D. Here in these uplands they formed a compact and homogeneous\\npopulation, spread over towns and country alike, and were occupied in\\nthe main with agrarian and pastoral pursuits. But they had in addition\\nmuch of the versatility and business capacity of the Jews, as well as a\\nstrong liberal-mindedness towards progress and education, and thus,\\nwhile they still continued up to the present day their pastoral life in\\nthe countryside, others gravitated towards towns, and by degrees they\\nspread over a large part of the Turkish Empire, until most of the towns\\nin Turkey had a progressive and peaceful quota of Armenian citizens,\\ntolerated by their Moslem neighbours, and, though possessed of no great\\nshare of political influence, powerful, in that the trade and commerce\\nof inland Turkey was largely in their hands. Wherever they went they\\nestablished their schools; many were lawyers, doctors, and professors of\\neducation. Certain repressive measures were brought to bear on them;\\nthey were not, for instance, allowed to carry arms, except when, in\\naccordance with Turkish conscriptive laws, they served in the Ottoman\\narmy. But many of them, by paying their exemption money, got off\\nmilitary service, and they confined themselves to the arts of peace,\\nwhether pastorally in their native highlands, or in the shops and\\noffices of the towns to which they migrated. They were not, till the\\ntime of Abdul Hamid, held to be in any sense a national danger, for,\\nexcept in Armenia proper, they were too scattered and too peace-loving\\nan element of the population to be capable of united action, and never\\ndo they seem to have provoked any outburst of Moslem fanaticism. They\\nhad local quarrels and fights with the more warlike Kurds who encroached\\non Armenia, and in the towns where they settled they often incurred the\\nvague jealousy and dislike which are the penalties of a race superior\\nmorally and intellectually to those among whom they live. But that\\nsuperiority constituted in course of time the 'Armenian question,' to\\nwhich Abdul Hamid alluded. In all, some sixty years ago their entire\\nrace numbered about 4,000,000 persons, of whom about 1,250,000 inhabited\\nRussian Trans-Caucasia, about 150,000 were in the province of\\nAdarbaijan, and there were smaller bodies of them in Austria and India.\\nThe remainder, some 2,500,000, were spread over Armenia, over the\\nvillages and towns of Turkey, notably the eastern edge of the Cilician\\nuplands, while in Constantinople itself there were certainly not less\\nthan 150,000, and probably as many as 200,000. To-day, the male portion\\nof the Armenian race in the Ottoman Empire has practically ceased to\\nexist: a quarter of a million men and women escaped over the Russian\\nfrontier, five thousand escaped to Egypt, and there are a few thousand\\nwomen and girls (it is impossible to ascertain the exact number) in\\nTurkish harems. Turkism, as administered by Abdul Hamid first, then, far\\nmore efficiently, by Enver Pasha, and Talaat Bey, has solved the\\nArmenian question.\\n\\nThe history of its solution falls under two heads, of which the first\\nconcerns the manner in which it was solved in Armenia itself, where the\\npopulation was almost exclusively Armenian, both in towns and in the\\ncountry. Here the eastern and north-eastern frontiers of Turkey, across\\nwhich lie the province of Russian Trans-Caucasia and Persia, pass\\nthrough the middle of districts peopled by men of Armenian blood, and\\nwhen, in the autumn of 1914, the Turks made their entry into the\\nEuropean War, their eastern armies, operating against Russia, found\\nthemselves confronted by troops among whom were many Armenians, while in\\ntheir advance into the Persian province of Adarbaijan, there were in the\\nranks of their opponents, Armenians and Syriac Christians. They advanced\\nin fact, in the first weeks of the war, into a country largely peopled\\nwith men of the same blood as those on their own side of the frontier.\\nThough the edict had not yet come from Constantinople for the massacre\\nof the Armenians (Talaat Bey did not complete his arrangements till the\\nfollowing April), the slaughter of them began then, first in the advance\\nof the Turkish armies, and following on that movement, which lasted but\\na few weeks, in their subsequent retreat before the Russians. All\\nvillages through which the Turkish armies passed were plundered and\\nburned, all the inhabitants on whom the Turks could lay their hands were\\nkilled. Sometimes women and children were given to the Kurds, who formed\\nbands of irregular troops in conjunction with the Turkish army, and\\nthese were outraged before they were slaughtered. A price was put on\\nevery Christian head, and in the Turkish retreat the corpses were thrust\\ninto the wells in order to pollute them. The excuse for this, as given\\nby German apologists (not apologists, perhaps, so much as supporters and\\nadherents of the policy), was that since behind the Turkish lines the\\ncountry was populated by a race of the same blood as that through which\\nthey advanced, and then retreated, extermination was necessary in order\\nto prevent or to punish treachery and collusion. But I have been nowhere\\nable to find that there were instances of such, nor that the Turks put\\nforward that excuse themselves. Indeed it would have been an unnecessary\\nexplanation, for but a few months after the opening of the war, Talaat\\nBey's plans were complete, and the extermination of Armenians hundreds\\nof miles from any sphere of military operations rendered it needless to\\nsay anything about it, or to invent instances of treachery if there were\\nactually none to hand.\\n\\nSimultaneously the massacre of Armenians behind the Turkish lines\\nbegan. The whole male population of the district round Bitlis was\\nmurdered, so too were all males in Bitlis itself. Then all women and\\nchildren were driven in, as a herdsman might drive sheep, from the\\nreeking villages round, and, for purposes of convenience, concentrated\\nin Bitlis. When they were all collected, they were driven in a flock to\\nthe edge of the Tigris, shot, and the corpses were thrown into the\\nriver. That was the solution of the Armenian question in Bitlis.\\n\\nNorth-west of Bitlis, and some sixty miles distant, lies the town of\\nMush. It used to contain about 25,000 Armenian inhabitants, and in the\\ndistrict round there were some three hundred villages chiefly consisting\\nof Armenians. Arrangements were on foot for a general massacre there\\nwhen the arrival of Russian troops at Liz, some fifteen hours' march\\naway, caused the execution of it to be put off for a while, and up till\\nJuly a few folk only had been shot, and a few beaten to death, as a\\nwarning to those treacherously inclined. Then the Russians, in the face\\nof superior forces, had to retire again, and the massacres were put on a\\nsystematic footing. The account which follows is based on four\\nindependent authorities: (1) The statement of a German eye-witness in\\nMush in charge of an Armenian orphanage; (2) the statement of a woman\\ndeported from a village near, and subsequently killed by Kurds; (3)\\ninformation from refugees escaped to Trans-Caucasia; (4) the journal\\n_Horizon_ of Tiflis. These supplement each other, often verify each\\nother, and in no instance are contradictory.\\n\\nRumours of an impending massacre reached Mush before the end of 1914, at\\na time when the massacres across the frontier had begun. The Mutessarif\\nof Mush, an intimate friend of Enver Pasha, had openly declared that 'at\\nan opportune moment' the slaughter of the whole Armenian race was\\ncontemplated, and later Ekran Bey corroborated this in the presence of\\nthe American and German Consuls. Enver indeed seems to have been the\\nchief organiser with regard to the massacres in Armenia itself, while\\nTalaat Bey saw to the fate of those dispersed in towns throughout the\\nrest of Turkey. During the whole of that winter, a very severe one,\\nsigns of the approaching extermination multiplied. In the villages round\\nfresh taxes were introduced, and when Armenians were unable to pay they\\nwere beaten to death, while, if they resisted, the village in question\\nwas burned. But by July 1915 (after the unavoidable delay caused by the\\nproximity of Russian troops) all was ready, and the massacre began in\\nearnest.\\n\\nFour battalions of Turkish troops arrived from Constantinople, and an\\norder was given that all Armenians must leave the town within three\\ndays, after 'registering themselves' at the Government office. The women\\nand children were to remain, but their money and their property would be\\nconfiscated. Within two hours after that, owing, I suppose, to fresh\\norders from Constantinople, the guns opened fire on the crowds in the\\nstreets flocking to the registry offices, and after that systematic\\nhouse-to-house murder began. Prominent Armenians were tortured to\\ndeath, houses containing women and children were set on fire, a body of\\nmen collected together was thrown into the river, girls were outraged\\nand slaughtered. For two days the massacre continued, and by the end of\\nthe second day the Armenian question was solved as regards Mush.\\n\\nIn the surrounding villages the same Prussian thoroughness was observed,\\nand out of all the inhabitants of the plain 5000 only seemed to have\\nsurvived, who fled to Sasun (there to be subsequently massacred in\\n1916), while a few from outlying villages escaped to the Russian troops.\\nIn certain villages the girls and young women were given to the Kurd\\nsoldiery, who raped them publicly in the presence of their families, not\\nsparing girls of eight and ten years of age, who then, bleeding and\\nviolated, were shot in company with the old women, for whom the Kurds\\n(inspired by Allah, the God of Love) had no use. Elsewhere, as the story\\nof a deported woman from Kheiban tells us, the women guarded by Kurdish\\ntroops were driven out of their villages, leaving behind the corpses of\\nthe men and of old women who could not walk, and for days were marched\\nalong the roads, nearly naked, under the fierce heat of the July sun.\\nOnce every other day they were given bread, but all did not get it, and\\nmany fell exhausted by the wayside, and were either whipped to their\\nfeet again or allowed to lie down and die. As they passed through\\nvillages Kurds would come out and rape a girl or two, and when they\\nhalted at night their guards would come among them.... Some few escaped;\\nthe rest, in dwindling company, went on through days of blinding sun and\\nnights of shame till at last there were only a few remaining. It was not\\nworth while going farther, for the work of Enver Pasha was nearly done,\\nand the rest were pushed into the river. One alone survived, who could\\nswim, and she, with her two-year-old baby on her back, got across the\\nstream and made her way to a village where were a party of Armenians who\\nhad escaped massacre. She arrived there at midnight, and at first they\\nthought she was a ghost. To them she told her story of the outraged and\\never-dwindling caravan of helpless women and girls driven onwards all\\nday beneath the smiting arrows of the sun, and encamped by the wayside,\\nwhere they halted with their barbarous guards and their lusts for a\\nterror by night. Of them none but this one was left, who had carried her\\nbaby with her every step of that infernal pilgrimage. Two days\\nafterwards he died from want of nourishment, and before the week was out\\nthe mother fell into the hands of a body of patrolling Kurds, and was\\nkilled.\\n\\nSo the problem of the village of Kheiban was solved, and if in the\\nhistory of the crimes that have blackened the earth with wanton cruelty\\nand made God to hide His face, there is any so atrocious a tale, I do\\nnot know it. But if among the annals of heroism and of mother-love we\\nwant to find a nobler record than that of this woman of Kheiban, equally\\nam I at a loss as to where we should look for it. Among the true and\\ngolden legends of the world shall that which she did be inscribed for a\\nmemorial of her.\\n\\nNorthward from Mush, and Bitlis lies the province of Erzerum, with the\\ntown of the same name, that contained in the autumn of 1914 some 20,000\\nArmenians. Here the first hint of coming trouble was the order that all\\nArmenian soldiers serving in Turkish ranks should be disarmed. This was\\nfollowed in June by another order that all the inhabitants of the\\nhundred villages in the district should leave their homes at two hours'\\nnotice. They numbered between 10,000 and 15,000 persons. Of these a few\\ntook refuge with friendly Kurds, but of the remainder a few only lived\\nto reach Erzinjan, where they were again deported, and the rest were\\nmurdered as they marched. In Erzerum itself orders were received by\\nTahsin Bey, the Vali of the town, that all Armenians were to be killed\\nwithout distinction of age or sex. He refused to carry this order out,\\nbut his unwillingness was overruled.[1] Simultaneously, the German\\nConsul telegraphed protests to his Ambassador at Constantinople, and\\nwas told that Germany could not interfere in the internal affairs of\\nTurkey.\\n\\n[Footnote 1: At Angora a similar refusal on the part of the Governor\\nresulted in his dismissal, and the same thing happened at Konia and at\\nKutaia.]\\n\\nHere the method employed was deportation: the victims were murdered, not\\nin the town itself, but were given orders to leave their homes, and\\nunder guard march (for no conveyances were given them) to other\\ndistricts. The first company was to go to Diarbekr. All these, with the\\nexception of one man and forty women, were murdered on the first day's\\nmarch. The remainder reached Kharput, which was another station or\\ncollecting place for the deported. A German eye-witness tells us what\\nfate waited them. 'They have had their eyebrows plucked out, their\\nbreasts cut off, their nails torn off; their torturers hew off their\\nfeet, or else hammer nails into them as they do in shoeing horses. This\\nis all done at night-time, in order that people may not hear their\\nscreams and know of their agony. Soldiers are stationed round the\\nprisons, beating drums and blowing whistles. It is needless to relate\\nthat many died of these tortures. When they die, the soldiers cry, \\\"Now\\nlet your Christ help you.\\\"' A second caravan of five hundred families\\nleft Erzerum: at Baiburt they were joined by another contingent deported\\nfrom that town, and the account that follows is based on the information\\nsupplied by the Rev. Robert Stapleton, an American minister at Erzerum,\\nand by an Armenian woman who was among the deported, and whose life was\\nspared on her embracing Islamism.\\n\\nThe convoy numbered, when it left Baiburt, some 15,000 persons, and it\\nreached Erzinjan in safety. There the massacres had already taken place,\\nand the women and children had been deported, for they found no\\nArmenians there. But the convoy had not yet arrived at its goal, and it\\nstarted out again moving south by east till it came to Kamakh. There\\nbands of Kurds descended on them, and in the space of seven days every\\nmale above fifteen years of age, including an aged priest of ninety, was\\nkilled. Thereafter a pilgrimage of women, as from Kheiban, moved\\nsouthwards across plain and mountain, and every day its numbers were\\ndiminished, for the youthful and the good-looking were carried off by\\nbrigands. At night they were halted outside villages, and the gendarmes\\nand villagers took what they chose. Many died from hunger and\\nheat-stroke: others were left by the wayside. When they came to the\\nbanks of the river Kara-Su there was a debauch of horror. Women and\\ngirls and little children were raped and mutilated, and the children who\\nstill survived were thrown into the river. Those who could swim were\\nshot. Thereafter the movements of this caravan are hard to trace.\\nProbably there was then but little left of it. But others followed on\\nthe same route 'through fields and hillsides dotted with swollen and\\nblackened corpses that filled and fouled the air with their stench.'\\nSome of them reached Mosul, some reached Aleppo, another collecting\\nstation, where, by the mouth of other witnesses, we shall hear of them\\nagain.\\n\\nCorroborative and additional evidence is given by the Danish Red Cross\\nnurses who, with a noble disregard of their own safety, accompanied one\\nof these caravans from Erzerum to Erzinjan. They speak of the massacres\\nat Kamakh, of the killing by the river, and of a _battue_ through the\\ncornfields, where the wheat was high, into which some Armenians had\\nescaped. At one time these Danish Sisters were in the charge of a\\ngendarme who had superintended a massacre of 3000 women and children\\ndriven from their homes into the country, rounded up and killed. He told\\nthe Sisters that this was the best method of getting rid of them, for\\nthey should be made to suffer first, and besides it would be\\ninconvenient for Moslems to live in a village with so many corpses\\nabout. At another place they came to a shambles, where Armenian\\nsoldiers, deprived of their arms, and sent to make roads, had been\\nslaughtered: at another there were three gangs of labourers, one Moslem,\\none Greek, and one Armenian. These latter were guarded. Presently, as\\nthey proceeded along their road, they looked round and saw that the\\nArmenian gang was being formed up by itself, a little off the\\nhighroad....\\n\\nAnd so the ghastly record went on all over Armenia. At one place only,\\nthe town of Van, was any resistance organised. There, after the massacre\\nhad begun, some 1500 Armenians got hold of arms (probably many of these\\nmen were soldiers who had not yet had their arms taken from them), and\\nfor the space of twenty-seven days defended themselves against five\\nthousand Turkish troops, till the Russian advance relieved them. During\\nthat advance Armenian refugees, into whose districts the massacres had\\nnot yet penetrated, fled for refuge to the invading army, and in all\\nsome 250,000 Armenians under its protection crossed in safety the\\nRussian frontier into Trans-Caucasia. How many died on the way from\\nhunger and exhaustion is not known. Cholera, dysentery, and spotted\\nfever broke out among them, and the path of their passage was lined with\\ndead and dying. Companies of Kurds made descents upon them, taking toll\\nof their maidenhood, but, with the Russian line to protect them at their\\nrear, they struggled on out of the cemetery and brothel of their native\\ncountry, and out of the accursed confines of that hell on earth, the\\nOttoman Empire, leaving behind them the murdered myriads of their\\nhusbands and their sons, their violated wives and daughters. Through\\nincredible hardships they passed, but, unlike the other pilgrimages we\\nhave briefly traced, they moved not towards death, but towards safety\\nand life, and their dark steps were lightened with Hope.\\n\\nBefore the last of those who survived the hunger and the pestilence of\\nthat pilgrimage had reached Russian soil, it is probable that in all\\nArmenia there was not a man of their race left alive, nor a woman either\\nunless she had accepted Islamism and the life of the harem. A peaceful\\nand progressive nation had been wiped out with every accompaniment of\\nhorror and cruelty and bestial lust, and in Armenia itself there would\\nnever more be an Armenian question. Abdul Hamid had hinted at the\\nsolution of it, and had made, as we have seen, experiments in that\\ndirection; but it was reserved for Enver Pasha and Talaat Bey,\\nenlightened men of the Young Turk party, with the advantages of a\\nPrussian example, to complete the work. Already Enver had said that he\\nwould never rest until the last Armenian in the Ottoman Empire had been\\nkilled, and before the end of 1915, as far as Armenia itself went, he\\nwas able to see a reasonable prospect of repose before him. But there\\nwas much work still left to do in other provinces.\\n\\nWe have seen that for the extirpation of Armenians in Armenia proper,\\nthe excuse put forward, if not by the Turks themselves, by their German\\napologists, was the necessity of guarding against treachery in the\\nvicinity of the Turkish army, and against spying and collusion between\\nthe Armenians behind the Russian lines and those behind Turkish lines.\\nThe same pretext was put forward for the massacres and deportations from\\nThrace, from Constantinople, and from the shores of the Sea of Marmora.\\nHere, if anywhere, there may be thought to be some justification for\\nmeasures which might have been undertaken for the sake of public safety.\\nAt any rate, there were definite charges brought against Armenians in\\nthese districts, and the Armenian boatmen of Silivri, for instance, were\\nimprisoned, but not, as far as I know, massacred, on the charge of\\nrevictualling English submarines, which at that time, as the reader will\\nremember, had penetrated into the Sea of Marmora, and indeed had reached\\nConstantinople itself. It is not, of course, consonant with Turkish or\\nPrussian justice to substantiate charges before inflicting penalties, it\\nis sufficient in the new World-justice to accuse. But here round\\nConstantinople, there was some pretence at procedure before resorting to\\nmurder and deportation. A register was drawn up of all Armenians\\nresident in the capital, dividing into separate classes those who were\\nborn in Constantinople, and those who were immigrants from Armenia, with\\na view to deporting those who were not native to the city. Here, I\\nthink, we may see traces of the Prussian instinct for tabulation, for\\nclassification, for category-mongering. Enver and his colleagues lost\\npatience with these dilatory tactics. The Armenians of the province of\\nBrussa were deported wholesale, and long before the registration lists\\nof Constantinople were finished, all Armenians were moved out of the\\ntown. Ten thousand males were massacred in the mountains of Ismid, and\\nthe Armenian women and children taken into collecting stations for\\ndeportation to 'agricultural colonies' (so the phrase ran in the\\nPecksniff language of Prussia) situated in the Anatolian desert, in the\\ndesert of Arabia, and in malarious marshes on the Euphrates. With this\\nclearing out of Armenians from Thrace, from Constantinople, and from\\nArmenia itself, we have finished with our first class of the Armenian\\natrocities. For it reasons were at least invented by German apologists.\\nMilitary necessities, which here, as in Belgium, knew no law, dictated\\nit; the frightfulness involved was incidental to War. But such\\nconsiderations were not even alleged for the second class of the\\nmurder-scheme. Before passing on, it will be well to review, quite\\nshortly, the reasons which dictated it, and penetrate into the infernal\\ncouncils of Enver Pasha and Talaat Bey.\\n\\nThe text of the scheme is to be found in the defined policy of the\\nYoung Turk party as set forth in their Congress of 1911. 'Turkey must\\nbecome a really Mohammedan country, and Moslem ideas and Moslem\\ninfluence must be preponderant.... Sooner or later the complete\\nOttomanisation of all Turkish subjects must be effected: it is clear,\\nhowever, that this can never be attained by persuasion, but that we must\\nresort to armed force.'\\n\\nThere is the text that was expanded into the discourse of murder; it is\\nthe definition of a policy. Within a few years there followed the\\nEuropean War, and that probably was the immediate cause of its being put\\ninto effect. No more admirable opportunity for Ottomanisation could\\npresent itself, for the entry of Turkey into the war was most unpopular\\nwith the bulk of the Turkish population, and it was advisable to bribe\\nthem into acceptance of it. The bribe was the houses, the property, the\\nmoney and the trade that throughout the length and breadth of Turkey was\\nin Armenian hands. For the Armenians were by far the wealthiest of the\\nalien populations, and some 90 per cent. of Turkish trade passed through\\ntheir shops and offices. Here, then, was the psychological moment:\\nTurkey for the Turk was the aim of the Committee of Union and Progress,\\nand with a discontented population, unwilling to fight, the moment had\\ncome for restoring to the Turk this mass of property which at present\\nbelonged to an alien race. War might have its drawbacks and its clouds,\\nbut war would be seen to have its advantages and its silver linings, if\\nout of it there came this legacy of Armenian wealth. And by the same\\nstroke Turkey could get rid of those thousands of meddlesome\\nmissionaries, American and French, who spread religion and learning and\\nother undesirable things among the cursed race. Once remove the cursed\\nrace, and there would be an end of their instructors also, for there\\nwould be none to instruct. 'Thanks to their schools,' so we read in the\\n_Hilal_, an organ of the Young Turks, 'foreigners were able to exercise\\ngreat moral influence over the young men of the country.... By closing\\nthem (i.e. by exterminating their pupils) the Government has put an end\\nto a situation as humiliating as it was dangerous.'\\n\\nSuch, then, was the spirit that animated Enver and Talaat, and during\\nthe winter of 1914-15 they perfected their plans. The Armenian race was\\nto cease, and the Valis and other officials were, each in his district,\\nto see to the thoroughness of its cessation. Sometimes, as happened at\\nErzerum, the Vali in question, not having the broad out-look of Enver,\\nor quaintly and curiously having a womanish objection to the national\\nduty of flogging men to death and giving over young girls to a barbarous\\nsoldiery, remonstrated with the authorities, or even refused to obey\\norders. Such a one was instantly removed from his office, and a\\nstauncher patriot substituted. All was put on an orderly footing: here\\nKurds were to be employed on the old Abdul Hamid formula, who by way of\\nwage would enjoy the privilege of raping as many women and girls out of\\ntheir hapless convoy as seemed desirable, while in agricultural\\ndistricts they were allowed also to take over the sheep and cattle of\\ntheir murdered victims. Here, in towns where there was more chance of\\nresistance than in scattered homesteads, it would be wise to employ\\nregular troops, backed, if necessary, by artillery, to whom would be\\nentrusted the murder of the whole male population, after suitable\\ntortures, supposing the executioners had a taste for the sport, and to\\nthem was given the right of general plunder. Then, as soon as the number\\nand capacity of the vacant houses were telegraphed to Constantinople,\\noccupiers from the discontented townsfolk and natives of Thrace were\\nassigned to them. Sometimes there would be a big school building to give\\naway as well, but that was not always so, for it might be more\\nconvenient to assemble Armenians there for purposes of registration or\\nso forth, and then, if it happened to catch fire, why Enver would\\nunderstand that such accidents would occur. Among other careful and\\nwell-thought-out instructions came the order that, when possible, the\\nmurders should not take place in the town, but outside it, for clean\\nAllah-fearing Moslems would not like to live in habitations defiled by\\nChristian corpses. But, above all, there must be thoroughness; not a man\\nmust be left alive, not a girl nor a woman who must not drag her\\noutraged body, so long as breath and the heart-beat remained in it, to,\\nor rather towards those 'agricultural colonies,' as Talaat Bey, in a\\nflash of whimsical Prussian humour, called them. One was advantageously\\nsituated in the middle of the Anatolian desert at the village of\\nSultanieh. There, for miles round, stretched the rocks and sands of a\\nwaterless wilderness, but no doubt the women and children of this very\\nindustrious race would manage to make it wave with cornfields. Another\\nagricultural colony, by way of contrast, should be established a couple\\nof days' journey south of Aleppo, where the river loses itself in\\npestilential and malarious swamps. Arabs could not live there, but who\\nknew whether those hardy Armenians (the women and children, of them at\\nleast who had proved themselves robust enough to reach the place) would\\nnot flourish there out of harm's way? After the swamps one came to the\\nArabian desert, and there, a hundred miles south-east, was a place\\ncalled Deir-el-Zor; wandering Arab tribes sometimes passed through it,\\nbut, arrived there, the Armenians should wander no more. In those arid\\nsands and waterless furnaces of barren rock there was room for all and\\nto spare. Sultanieh, the swamps, and Deir-el-Zor: these were the chief\\nof Talaat Bey's agricultural colonies.\\n\\nThere must be collecting stations for these tragic colonists, centres to\\nwhich they must be herded in from surrounding districts: one at\\nOsmanieh, let us say, one at Aleppo, one at Ras-el-Ain, one at Damascus.\\nAnd since it would be a pity to let so many flowers of girlhood waste\\ntheir sweetness on the desert air of Deir-el-Zor, slave markets must be\\nestablished at these collecting stations. There would be plenty of\\ngirls, and prices would be low, but the reverend ministers of Allah the\\nGod of Love, the Ulemas, the Padis and the Muftis, should be accorded a\\npreferential tariff. Indeed they should pay nothing at all; they should\\njust choose a girl and take her away, and, with the help of Allah the\\nGod of Love, convert her to the blessed creed. No one was too young for\\nthese lessons.... A little abstemiousness would not hurt these pampered\\nChristians, so when they set out on their marches they need not be\\nprovided with rations or water. Perhaps some might die, but Talaat had\\nno use for weaklings at his agricultural colonies. Nor must there be any\\npoking and prying on the part of those interfering American\\nmissionaries; and so Talaat Bey put all the agricultural colonies out of\\nbounds for foreigners....\\n\\nThere was no hurry over these deportations, for the plea of military\\nexigencies, which had caused the deportations in Armenia itself to be\\nterminated by massacre with a rapidity almost inartistic, did not apply\\nto Armenians so far from the seat of war. Their picnics could be\\nconducted quietly and pleasantly in the leisurely Oriental manner. Even\\nthe men need not be murdered absolutely out of hand. Strong young\\nfellows might be stripped and tied down and then beaten to death by\\nbastinadoing the feet till they burst, or by five hundred blows on the\\nchest and stomach. Their cries would mingle with the screams of their\\nsisters in the embrace of Turkish soldiers. And, talking of embraces, if\\na woman was desirable, she need not walk all the way to Deir-el-Zor, but\\nby embracing Islamism be transferred to a harem. But these were details\\nthat might be left to individual taste: there were no precise\\ninstructions save that no Armenian men must be discoverable in the\\nOttoman Empire at all, and no women save those who had become Turkish\\nwomen, or who were at work on the waterless and the malarial\\nagricultural colonies.\\n\\nTalaat Bey reviewed his finished scheme. He thought it would do, and\\nEnver Pasha agreed with him, and Jemal Bey (who soon after styled\\nhimself Jemal the Great), the Military Governor of Syria, and so\\nresponsible for the last stages of their pilgrimage, thought it would do\\nvery well indeed. And instructions were sent out to every town in the\\nEmpire where there were Armenians, in accordance with the programme of\\nTalaat Bey.\\n\\nHow Enver carried out his part of the programme in Armenia itself we\\nhave seen, and by the end of the year (1915) his work was done, and\\nArmenia was Armenia no longer. But operations, as I have said, were\\nconducted in a more leisurely manner elsewhere, and the agony of that\\nbutchery protracted. But Jemal got to work at once in the thickly\\npopulated district round Zeitun. He had had no success in the campaign\\nof the winter in the direction of the Suez Canal, and his troops were\\nhungry for some sort of victory. The Zeitunlis were hardy independent\\nmountaineers, who were possessed of arms, and Jemal thought it more\\nprudent not to dally with deportations, but conduct a regular campaign\\nagainst them. For two or three months they resisted, entrenching\\nthemselves in the hills, but they could not hold out against artillery\\nand the modern apparatus of war, and the whole tribe was wiped out. That\\ndone, Jemal became Jemal the Great by reason of his national services,\\nand paid a visit to Germany. On his return we shall hear of him again.\\n\\nMeanwhile, from all the reports that have arrived from missionaries and\\nothers, we may take one or two, almost at random. At certain places, as\\nin the governments of Ismid, Angora and Diarbekr, the Armenian\\npopulation was completely wiped out. Sometimes tortures were added, as\\nat a certain Anatolian town where there was a big Armenian school, in\\nwhich a number of professors and instructors, some of whom had studied\\nin America, in Scotland, and in Germany, had for years been working.\\n\\nWhat happened to them was this:--\\n\\n(1) Professor A served the College thirty-five years, and taught\\nTurkish and history. He was arrested without charge, the hair of his\\nhead and beard were pulled out in order to secure damaging confessions.\\nHe was starved and hung up by the arms for a day and a night and\\nrepeatedly beaten. He was then murdered.\\n\\n(2) Professor B, who had served the College thirty-three years, and\\ntaught mathematics, suffered the same fate.\\n\\n(3) Professor C, head of the preparatory department, had served the\\nCollege for twenty years. He was made to witness the spectacle of a man\\nbeing beaten almost to death, and became mentally deranged. He was\\nmurdered with his family.\\n\\n(4) Professor D, who taught mental and moral sciences, was treated in\\nthe same way as Professor A. He also had three finger nails pulled out\\nby the roots, and was subsequently murdered.\\n\\nSimilarly, at Diarbekr, the Armenians were collected in batches of 600,\\ntaken out of the town, and killed to the last man. Among them was the\\nArmenian Archbishop; his eyes and nails were dragged out before he was\\nbutchered.\\n\\nOr let us take a look at some of the collecting camps. At one, described\\nby an eye-witness, we find that the convoy had arrived after several\\nmonths of travel. More than half were already dead, they had been\\npillaged by bandits and Kurds seven times. They were forbidden to drink\\nwater when they passed by a stream, three-quarters of the young women\\nand girls had been kidnapped, the rest were compelled to sleep with the\\ngendarmes who conducted them. At Osmanieh it was decided to deport the\\nwomen and children by train. They lay about the station starving and\\nfever-stricken. When the train arrived many were jostled on to the line,\\nand the driver yelled with joy, crying out, 'Did you see how I smashed\\nthem up?'\\n\\nAt another camp typhus broke out; those who died of it were left\\nunburied, as vouched for by a Turkish officer, in order to increase the\\ninfection....\\n\\nUrfa was another collecting camp for the Armenians in that district, and\\nthe following account is based on the information of an eye-witness.\\nHere, before the concentration began, the Armenians living in the town\\noffered resistance to the Turks, and held out until Fahri Bey, second in\\ncommand to Jemal the Great, arrived with artillery, bombarded the town,\\nand massacred every Armenian there. Quiet being thus restored, the bands\\nof deported began to arrive. They came by rail or on foot, and, with\\nthe Prussian love of tabulation, were divided into three groups.\\n\\nThe first group consisted of old men, old women, and young children.\\nThey, guarded by gendarmes, were sent marching through the desert to\\nDeir-el-Zor. Few, if any, ever arrived there, all dying by the way.\\n\\nThe second group, consisting of able-bodied men, was led off in batches\\nand slaughtered. Among them were Zohrab and Vartkes, Armenian deputies\\nwho had been brought there from Constantinople.\\n\\nThe third group consisted of young marriageable girls. Some, perhaps,\\nfound their way into harems.\\n\\nFrom Aleppo (one of the final concentration camps before such as were\\nleft of the convoys set forth for their goal, the swamps or the desert\\nround Deir-el-Zor) we have the detailed evidence of Dr. Martin Niepage,\\nHigh Grade teacher in the German Technical School. This gentleman, with\\na courage and a humanity to which the highest tribute must be paid,\\naddressed a report of protest to the German Ambassador at\\nConstantinople, and wrote an open letter to the Reichstag on the subject\\nof what he had seen with his own eyes in that town. In his preliminary\\nmatter he speaks as follows:--\\n\\n'In dilapidated caravanserais I found quantities of dead, many corpses\\nbeing half-decomposed, and others still living among them who were soon\\nto breathe their last. In other yards I found quantities of sick and\\ndying people, whom nobody was looking after.... We teachers and our\\npupils had to pass them every day. Every time we went out we saw through\\nthe open windows their pitiful forms, emaciated and wrapped in rags. In\\nthe morning our school children, on their way through the narrow\\nstreets, had to push past the two-wheeled ox-carts on which every day,\\nfrom eight to ten rigid corpses without coffin or shroud, were carried\\naway, their arms and legs trailing out of the vehicle.'\\n\\nFrom the report itself:--\\n\\n'Out of convoys which, when they left their homes on the Armenian\\nplateau, numbered from two to three thousand men, women, and children,\\nonly two or three hundred survivors arrived here in the south. The men\\nwere slaughtered on the way, the women and girls, with the exception of\\nthe old, the ugly and those who are still children, have been abused by\\nTurkish soldiers and officers.... Even when they are fording rivers they\\ndo not allow those dying of thirst to drink. All the nourishment they\\nreceive is a daily ration of a little meal sprinkled on their hands....\\nOpposite the German Technical School at Aleppo, a mass of about four\\nhundred emaciated forms, the remnant of such convoys, is lying in one of\\nthe caravanserais. There are about a hundred children (boys and girls)\\namong them, from five to seven years old. Most of them are suffering\\nfrom typhoid and dysentery. When one enters the yard, one has the\\nimpression of entering a madhouse. If one brings food, one notices that\\nthey have forgotten how to eat.... If one gives them bread, they put it\\naside indifferently. They just lie there quietly waiting for death.'\\n\\nDr. Niepage wrote this report in the hope of saving such as then (1915)\\nsurvived. No notice whatever was taken of it, and his postscript,\\nwritten in May 1916, records the fact that 'the exiles encamped at\\nRas-el-Ain on the Bagdad Railway, estimated at 20,000 men, women and\\nchildren, were slaughtered to the last one.'[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: It is right to add that at Aleppo an officer called Bekir\\nSami guarded 50,000 Armenians whom he had collected from neighbouring\\ndistricts, who were threatened with massacre, and I find that a German\\nmissionary states that there were 45,000 Armenians alive in Aleppo. This\\nforms confirmatory evidence, but at the same time there is nothing to\\nshow that they were not subsequently deported to Deir-el-Zor. In this\\ncase it is highly improbable that any survive.]\\n\\nIn Dr. Niepage's view, as I have stated elsewhere, the Germans are\\ndirectly responsible for the continuance of the massacres. Such, too, is\\nthe opinion, he tells us, of the educated Moslems, and his courage in\\nstating this has lost him his post at Aleppo. It is to be sincerely\\nhoped that he has escaped the fate of a certain Dr. Lepsius, who, for\\ndrawing attention to the fact that Germany allowed the Armenian\\nmassacres, has been arrested for high treason.\\n\\nBefore the end of 1915 the German authorities, who had refused to\\ninterfere in the massacres, and both in the official press and through\\nofficial utterances had expressed their support of this Ottomanisation\\nof the Empire, began to think that you might have too much of a good\\nthing, and that the massacres had really gone far enough. Their reason\\nwas clear and explicit: there would be a very serious shortage of labour\\nin the beet-growing industry and in the harvest-fields, for which they\\nhad sent grain and artificial manures from Germany. There had been some\\ntalk, they said, of saving 500,000 Armenians out of the race, but, in\\nthe way things were going on, it seemed that the remnant would not\\nnearly approach that figure. Would not the great Ottomanisers temper\\ntheir patriotism with a little clemency? Talaat Bey disagreed: he wanted\\nto make a complete job of it, but Jemal the Great, fresh from his visit\\nto Germany, supported the idea, and, in spite of Talaat's opposition,\\nmade a spectacular exhibition of clemency, in which, beyond doubt, we\\ncan trace an 'Imitatio Imperatoris,' in the following manner.\\n\\nThere was at the time a large convoy of men and women in Constantinople\\nwhich was to be led out for murder and deportation, and Jemal gave\\norders that it should be spared and sent back to its highland home. He\\ngave orders also that the entire convoy should be informed who was their\\nsaviour, and should be led in procession past his house and show their\\ngratitude. All day the sorry pageant lasted, the ragged, half-starved\\ncrowd streamed by the house of Jemal the Great, with murmurs of\\nthanksgiving and uplifted hands, and all manner of obeisances, while\\nJemal the Great stood in his porch with stern, impassive face, and hand\\non his sword-hilt in the best Potsdam manner, and acknowledged these\\nthanksgivings....[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: In support of Jemal's claim to clemency it must be added\\nthat, according to a report coming from Alexandria, he hanged twelve of\\nthe worst assassins sent to Syria as ringleaders of the massacres. I\\ncannot find corroboration of this.]\\n\\nHere, then, is the absurd, the Williamesque side of this ludicrous\\npopinjay, Jemal the Great, and it contains not only the obvious seeds of\\nlaughter, but the more helpful seeds of hope. He has a strong hand on\\nthe very efficient army of Syria, and his visits to Berlin seem perhaps\\nto have turned his head not quite in the direction that the\\nMaster-egalo-megalomaniac of Berlin intended. I gather that Jemal the\\nGreat was not so much impressed by the magnificence of William II. as to\\nfall dazzled and prone at the Imperial feet, and lick with enraptured\\ntongue the imperial boot polish, but rather to be inspired to do the\\nsame himself, to become the God-anointed of the newly acquired German\\nprovince, which is Turkey, and make a Potsdam of his own. This is only a\\nguess, but the conduct of Jemal the Great in the matter of these\\nArmenian refugees, and in other affairs, has been distinctly imperial.\\nIn June of this year, for instance, he telegraphed to H.E. the Vali of\\nSyria, and an extract from his text is truly Potsdamish. 'One and a half\\nmillion of sandbags,' he wrote, 'are required for the fortress of\\nGaza.... The bags should be made, if necessary, of all the silk-hangings\\nin houses of Syria and Palestine.' With his army behind him, he has\\ntwice already defied the orders of Talaat, and I am inclined to think\\nthat he is the coming Strong Man of the effete Empire with whom it would\\nbe well worth while to make friends, even at a highish price. The Allied\\nPowers should keep an undazzled eye on him, for it is quite possible\\nthat, having defied Talaat successfully, he may go on to defy the real\\nrulers of Turkey, who live in Berlin. His Syrian army, from such sources\\nas are available, appears to be more efficient than any other body of\\ntroops the Turks can put into the field, and he has them in control.\\nProbably in the winter of 1917-1918 our troops will come into collision\\nwith them. But in the interval, also quite probably, Jemal the Great may\\nresent German superintendence.[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: See note at end of this chapter.]\\n\\nBut in addition to his ludicrous side, there is in him a refined\\nhypocrisy and a subtle cruelty worthy of Abdul Hamid. One instance will\\nsuffice.\\n\\nThere had been some talk that at certain of these concentration camps\\nthere was no water supply, and he gave orders, did Jemal the Great and\\nthe Merciful, that water should be sent. A train consisting of trucks\\nof water accordingly was despatched to one of those camps, situated in\\nthe desert, with no supply nearer than six miles, and an eye-witness\\ndescribes its arrival. The mob of Armenians, mad with thirst, surrounded\\nit, and, since everything must be done in an orderly and seemly manner,\\nwere beaten back by the Turkish guards, and made to stand at a due\\ndistance for the distribution. And when those ranks, with their parched\\nthroats and sun-cracked lips, were all ready, the Turkish guards opened\\nthe taps of the reservoirs, and allowed the whole of their contents to\\nrun away into the sand. Whether Jemal the Great planned that, or whether\\nit was but a humorous freak on the part of the officials, I cannot say.\\nBut as a refinement of cruelty I have, outside the page of Poe's tales,\\nonly once come across anything to equal it, and that in a letter from\\nthe _Times'_ correspondent at Berne on April 11, 1917. He describes the\\ntreatment of English prisoners in Germany: 'An equally common\\nentertainment with those women (German Red Cross nurses) was to offer a\\nwounded man a glass, perhaps, of water, then, standing just outside his\\nreach, to pour it slowly on the ground.' Could those sisters of mercy\\nhave read the account of Jemal's clemency, or is it merely an instance\\nof the parallelism of similar minds?\\n\\nSo the empty train returned, and Jemal the Great caused it to be known\\nin Berlin that he was active in securing a proper water supply for the\\nfamous agricultural settlements in the desert, and loud were the\\nencomiums in the press of the Central Powers over the colonisation of\\nSyria by the Armenians, the progress and enlightenment of the Turks, and\\nthe skilful and humane organisation of Jemal the Great.\\n\\nThere is no difficulty in estimating to-day the number of Armenian men\\nwho survive in the Turkish Empire. All appeals to the Prussian\\noverlords, such as were made by Dr. Niepage, and the belated\\nremonstrance of the Prussians themselves when they foresaw a dearth of\\nlabour for the husbandry of beet and cereals, fell on deaf ears, and I\\ncannot see any reason for supposing that Armenian men exist any more in\\nthe Empire. It is more difficult to judge of the numbers of women who,\\nby accepting the Moslem creed and the harems, are still alive. Certainly\\nin some districts there were considerable 'conversions,' and Dr. Niepage\\nrates them as many thousands. But the willingness to accept those\\nconditions was not always a guarantee for their being granted, and I\\nhave read reports where would-be converts were told that 'religion' was\\na more serious matter than that, and, instead of being accepted, they\\nwere massacred. But even if Dr. Niepage is right, we can scarcely\\nconsider these women as constituting an Armenian element any more in the\\ncountry. The work of butchery, the torture, the long-drawn agonies of\\nthose inhuman pilgrimages have come to an end because there are no more\\nArmenian victims available. Apart from those who escaped over the\\nRussian frontier, and the handful who sought refuge in Egypt, the race\\nexists no longer, and the seal has been set on the bloodiest deed that\\never stained the annals of the barbarous Osmanlis. It is not in revenge\\non the murderers, but in order to rescue the other subject peoples,\\nArabs, Greeks, Jews, who are still enclosed within the frontiers of the\\nEmpire, that the Allied Governments, in their answer to President\\nWilson, stated that among their aims as belligerents, was the\\n'liberation of the peoples who now lie beneath the murderous tyranny of\\nthe Turks.' There is defined their irreducible demand: never again,\\nafter peace returns, will the Turk be allowed to control the destinies\\nof races not his own. Too long already--and to their disgrace be it\\nspoken--have the civilised and Christian nations of Europe tolerated at\\ntheir very doors a tyranny that has steadily grown more murderous and\\nmore monstrous, because they feared the upset of the Balance of Power.\\nNow at least such Powers as value national honour, and regard a national\\npromise as something more than a gabble of ink on a scrap of paper, have\\nresolved that they will suffer the tyranny of the Turk over his alien\\nsubject peoples to continue no longer. It is the least they can do (and\\nunhappily the most) to redeem the century-long neglect of their duty.\\nEven now, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter, the direst peril\\nthreatens those other peoples who at present groan under Turkish rule,\\nand we can but pray that the end of the war will come before Arabs or\\nGreeks or Jews suffer the same fate as has exterminated the Armenians.\\nToo often have we been too late; we must only hope that another item\\nwill not have to be added to that miserable list, and that, when the day\\nof reckoning comes, no half-hearted and pusillanimous policy will stay\\nour hands from the complete execution of that to which we stand pledged.\\nThe Balance of Power has gone the way of other rickety makeshifts, but\\nthere must be no makeshift in our dealings with the Turk, no compromise\\nand no delay. What shall be done with those who planned and executed the\\ngreatest massacres known to history matters little; let them be hanged\\nas high as Haman, and have done with them. But what does matter is that\\nat no future time must it be in the power of a Government that has never\\nbeen other than barbaric and butcherous, to do again as it has done\\nbefore.\\n\\nNOTE ON JEMAL THE GREAT\\n\\nJemal the Great has very obligingly done what I suggested we might\\nexpect him to do, and has kicked against the German control of the\\nSyrian army. General von Falkenhayn was sent to take supreme command,\\nand on June 28th of this year Jemal the Great refused to receive orders\\nfrom him. In consequence General von Falkenhayn refused responsibility\\nfor any offensive movement there if Jemal remained in command.\\n\\nThis promised well for trouble between Turks and Germans, but we must\\nnot, I am afraid, build very high hopes on it, for Germany has dealt\\nwith the situation in a masterly manner. Jemal was already Minister of\\nMarine as well as commander of the Syrian army, so the Emperor asked him\\nto pay another visit to Berlin, and he has been visiting Krupp's works\\nand German naval yards, and we shall find probably that in the future\\nhis activities will be marine rather than military, and that von\\nFalkenhayn will have a free hand in Syria.\\n\\nBut this will prove rather disappointing for Jemal, since it seems\\nbeyond mere coincidence that towards the end of August Herr von\\nKuhlmann, the new German Foreign Minister, induced the Turkish\\nGovernment (while Jemal was at Berlin) to put their navy and their\\nmerchant fleet under the orders of the German Admiralty, and already\\nmany Turkish naval officers have been replaced by Germans. Thus Jemal\\nwill find himself deprived of his military command, because the navy so\\nurgently needed his guiding hand, while his guiding hand over the navy\\nwill be itself guided by the German Admiralty.... In fact, it looks\\nrather like checkmate for Jemal the Great, and an end to the trouble he\\nmight have given the German control.\\n\\nOn the eve of his leaving Germany, as yet unconscious probably of the\\nsubordination of the entire Turkish fleet to the German Admiralty, he\\ngave an interview to a representative of the _Cologne Gazette_, which\\ndeserves more than that ephemeral appearance. It shows Jemal the Great\\nin a sort of hypnotic trance induced at Potsdam. 'The German fleet,' he\\nsays, 'is simply spotless in its power, and a model for all states which\\nneed a modern navy--a model which cannot be surpassed.' ... He went for\\na cruise in a submarine which proceeded 'so smoothly, elegantly, calmly\\nand securely that I had the impression of cruising in a great\\nsteamship.' ... He was taken to Belgium, and describes the 'idyllic life\\nthere': in the towns 'the people go for walks all day long,' and in the\\ncountry the peasants blithely gather in the harvest with the help of\\nhappy prisoners.' (He does not tell us where the harvest goes to, any\\nmore than the Germans tell us where the Turkish harvests go to.) He was\\ntaken to General Headquarters, which he describes as 'majestic.' Finally\\nhe was taken into the presence of the All-Highest, and seems to have\\nemerged in the condition in which Moses came down from Sinai.... But one\\nmust not altogether despair of Jemal the Great. It is still possible\\nthat, on his return to Constantinople, when he found that his position,\\nas Minister of Marine was but a clerkship in the German Admiralty, the\\nhypnotic trance began to pass off, and his ambitions to re-assert\\nthemselves. He may yet give trouble to the Germans if properly handled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Chapter IV_\\n\\n\\nTHE QUESTION OF SYRIA AND PALESTINE\\n\\nIt is impossible to leave this heart-rending tale of the sufferings of\\nthe Armenian people under the Turks without some account of that devoted\\nband of American missionaries who, with a heroism unsurpassed, and\\nperhaps unequalled, so eagerly sacrificed themselves to the ravages of\\npestilence and starvation in order to alleviate the horrors that\\ndescended on the people to whom they had been sent. Often they were\\nforcibly driven from the care of their flocks, often in the\\nextermination of their flocks there was none left whom they could\\nshepherd, but wherever a remnant still lingered there remained these\\ndauntless and self-sacrificing men and women, regardless of everything\\nexcept the cause to which they had devoted themselves. They recked\\nnothing of the dangers to which they exposed themselves so long as\\nthere was a child or a woman or a man whom they could feed or nurse.\\nTerrible as were the sufferings through which the Armenians passed, they\\nmust have been infinitely more unbearable had it not been for these\\nAmerican missionaries; small as was the remnant that escaped into the\\nsafety of Persia or Russian Trans-Caucasia, their numbers must have been\\nhalved had it not been for the heroism of these men and women. While the\\nGerman Consuls contented themselves with a few faint protests to their\\nAmbassador at Constantinople, followed by an acquiescence of silence,\\nthe missionaries constituted themselves into a Red Cross Society of\\nintrepid workers, and, as one well-qualified authority tells us,\\n'suffered as many casualties from typhus and physical exhaustion as any\\nproportionate body of workers on the European battlefields.' Fully\\nindeed did they live up to the mandate of the American board that sent\\nthem out: 'Your great business is with the fundamental doctrines and\\nduties of the Gospel.'\\n\\nAt the opening of the European War the American Missions had been at\\nwork for nearly a hundred years, and were disseminated over Anatolia and\\nArmenia. They had opened 163 Protestant churches and 450 schools, they\\nestablished hospitals, and in every possible way spread civilisation in\\na country where the spirit of the governing class was barbarism. It was\\nnot their object to proselytise. 'Let the Armenian remain an Armenian if\\nhe will,' so ran the instructions from which I have already quoted, 'the\\nGreek a Greek, the Nestorian a Nestorian, the Oriental an Oriental,' and\\nin the same wise and open-minded spirit they encouraged native\\nProtestant Churches which were independent of them and largely\\nself-supporting. Naturally in a country governed by monsters like Abdul\\nHamid and Enver Pasha in later days, they earned the enmity which is the\\ntribute of barbarians to those who stand for civilisation, and when,\\nowing to the extermination or flight of their Armenian flocks, they were\\nleft without a charge, and their schools were closed, we find a paean of\\nself-congratulation going up from the Turkish press inspired by the\\nbutchers of Armenia. But till the massacres and the flight were\\ncomplete, they gave themselves to the 'duties of the Gospel,' and their\\ndeeds shine like a star into the blackness of that night of murder.\\n\\nI will take as an example of the superb heroism of those men and women\\nthe diary of an American lady attached to the mission at Urmia, a\\ndocument that, anonymously, is one of the noblest, least self-conscious\\nrecords I have ever read. The period of it extends over five months.\\n\\nEarly in January 1915 the Russian troops were withdrawn from Urmia,\\nwhich lies on the frontier between Turkey and Persia, and simultaneously\\nthe Moslem population began to plunder the Christian villages, the\\ninhabitants of which fled for refuge to the missions in the city.\\nTalaat's official murder-scheme was not completed yet, but the Kurds,\\ntogether with the Turks, had planned a local massacre at Geogtapa, which\\nwas stopped by the American doctor of this mission, Dr. Packard, who, at\\ngreat personal risk, obtained an interview with the Kurdish chief, and\\nsucceeded in inducing him to spare the lives of the Christians, if they\\ngave up arms and ammunition and property. The American flag was hoisted\\nover the Mission buildings, and before a week was out there were over\\nten thousand refugees housed in the yards and rooms, where they remained\\nfor five months, the places of the dead being taken by fresh influxes.\\nThe dining-room, the sitting-room, the church, the school, were all\\ngiven over to these destitute people, and from the beginning fear of\\nmassacre, as well as prevalence of disease, haunted the camp. It was\\nimpossible to move dead bodies outside; they had to be buried in the\\nthronged yards, and every day children were born. But here is the spirit\\nthat animated their protectors. 'We have just had a Praise meeting,'\\nrecords the diarist at the close of the first fortnight, 'with fifty or\\nsixty we could gather from the halls and rooms near, and we feel more\\ncheerful. We thought if Paul and Silas, with their stripes, could sing\\npraises in prison, so could we.'\\n\\nThe weeks, of which each day was a procession of hours too full of work\\nto leave time for anxiety, began to enrol themselves into months, and\\nthe hope of rescue by a Russian advance made their hearts sick, so long\\nwas it deferred. Refugees from neighbouring villages kept arriving, and\\nthere was the constant problem before these devoted friends of their\\nflock, as to how to feed them. All such were welcome, and eager was the\\nwelcome they received, though every foot of space in the buildings and\\nin the yards was occupied. But somehow they managed to make room for all\\nwho came, and for those villagers who, under threat of torture and\\nmassacre, had apostatised, there was but yearning and sorrow, but never\\na word of blame or bitterness. Sometimes there was a visit of Turkish\\ntroops to search for concealed Russians, and, as our diarist remarks,\\n'We can't complain of the monotony of life, for we never know what is\\ngoing to happen next. On Tuesday morning we had a wedding in my room\\nhere. The boy and girl were simple villagers.... The wedding was fixed\\nfor the Syrian New Year, but the Kurds came and carried off wedding\\nclothes and everything else in the house. They all fled here, and were\\nmarried in the old dirty garments they were wearing when they ran for\\ntheir lives.... Their only present was a little tea and sugar that I\\ntied up in a handkerchief and gave to the bride.'\\n\\nThe eternal feminine and the eternal human speak there; and there, for\\nthis gallantest of women, were two keys that locked up the endless\\ntroubles and anxieties that ceased not day or night. But sometimes the\\nflesh was weak, and in the privacy of her diary she says, 'How long, O\\nLord?' But for that there was the master-key that unlocks all wards, and\\na little further on we read, 'One of the verses that helps to keep my\\nfaith steady is, \\\"He that spared not His own Son.\\\" For weeks we have had\\nno word from the outside world, but we \\\"rest in Jehovah and wait\\npatiently for Him.\\\"'\\n\\nThe conditions inside the crowded yards grew steadily worse. Dysentery\\nwas rife, and the deaths from it in that narrow space averaged thirty a\\nday. The state of the sufferers grew so terrible that it was difficult\\nto get any one to look after them at all, and many were lying in the\\nopen yards, and the weather, which hitherto had been warm, got cold, and\\nsnow fell. It was with the greatest difficulty that food could be\\nobtained for those in health, and that of a kind utterly unsuitable to\\nthe sick, while in the minds of their nurses was the bitter knowledge\\nthat with proper diet hundreds of lives could have been saved, and\\nhundreds of cases of illness avoided.\\n\\nFor the dead there was but a small percentage of coffins available, and\\n'the great mass are just dropped into the great trench of rotting\\nhumanity (in the yard). As I stand at my window I see one after another\\nof the little bodies carried by ... and the condition of the living is\\nmore pitiful than that of the dead--hungry, ragged, dirty, sick, cold,\\nwet, swarming with vermin. Not for all the wealth of all the rulers of\\nEurope would I bear for one hour their responsibility for the suffering\\nand misery of this one little corner of the world alone. A helpless\\nunarmed Christian community turned over to the sword and the passion of\\nIslam!'\\n\\nOn the top of this came an epidemic of typhoid, twenty-seven cases on\\nthe first day. Outside in the town the Turkish Consul began hanging\\nChristians, and the missioners were allowed to take the bodies and bury\\nthem. There were threats that the mission would be entered, and all\\nyoung men (possible combatants) killed, but this fear was not realised.\\nThe typhoid increased, and the doctor of the mission and others of the\\nstaff fell ill with it; but the patience and service of the remainder\\nnever faltered, while the same spirit of uncomplaining suffering\\nanimated the refugees. 'Mr. McDowell,' so the diarist relates, 'saw a\\ntired and weary woman with a baby in her arms, sitting in one of the\\nseats, and said to her, \\\"Where do you stay?\\\" She said \\\"Just here.\\\" \\\"How\\nlong have you been here?\\\" \\\"Since the beginning.\\\" (two months) she\\nreplied. \\\"How do you sleep at night?\\\" \\\"I lay the baby on the desk in\\nfront of me, and I have this post at the back to lean against. This is a\\nvery good place. Thank you very much.\\\"'\\n\\nIn April there comes a break in the diary after the day on which the\\nfollowing entry is made:--\\n\\n'I felt on Sunday as if I ought to get my own burial clothes ready, so\\nas to make as little trouble as possible when my time comes, for in\\nthese days we all go about our work knowing that any one of us may be\\nthe next to go down. And yet I think our friends would be surprised to\\nsee how cheerful we have kept, and how many occasions we find for\\nlaughing: for ludicrous things do happen. Then, too, after dwelling so\\nintimately with Death for three months, he doesn't seem to have so\\nunfriendly an aspect, and the \\\"Other Side\\\" seems near, and our Pilot\\nclose beside us.... I find the Rock on which I can anchor in peace are\\nthe words of Christ Himself: \\\"Where I am, there ye may be also.\\\" ...\\nThat is enough, to be where He is....'\\n\\nThen comes a break of two months, during which the writer was down with\\ntyphoid. She resumes again in June, finding that death has made many\\nchanges, and gets back to work again at once. By that time the Russians\\nhad entered Urmia, a thanksgiving service was held, the refugees\\ndispersed, and the American Mission went quietly on with its normal\\nwork.\\n\\nNow I have taken this one instance of the work of Americans at Urmia to\\nshow in some detail the character of the work that they were doing, and\\nthe Christian and humanising influence of it. But all over Armenia and\\nAnatolia were similar settlements, and, as already mentioned, at the\\ntime of the massacres there were established there over a hundred of\\ntheir churches and over four hundred schools, and from these extracts\\nwhich concern only one not very large centre, it may be gathered what\\nleaven of civilising influence the sum of their energies must have\\nimplied. That lamp shone steady and clear, a 'kindly light' in the\\ndarkness of Turkish misrule, and in the havoc of the massacres a beacon\\nof hope, not always reached by those hapless refugees. Indeed it seems\\nto have been only on the frontier that the missions were able to save\\nthose foredoomed hordes of fleeing Christians; in Armenia and in\\nAnatolia generally the massacres and 'deportations' were complete, and\\nby the end of 1915 all American missions were closed, for there were\\nnone to tend and care for. Even if the massacres had not occurred, the\\nentry of America into the war would have resulted in a similar cessation\\nof their work, and most probably in a massacre of the American\\nmissioners themselves. Their withdrawal, of course, was hailed with a\\npeacock scream of pride by that enlightened body under Talaat and Enver,\\ncalled the New Turkish party of Progress, for their presence was a bar\\nto the Turkish notions of civilisation, in that their influence made for\\nhumanity, and health and education. Now 'the humiliating and dangerous\\nsituation' (to quote from the columns of _Hilal_) was put an end to, and\\nTurkish progress could make headway again.\\n\\nSimilarly in Syria the outbreak of war put an end to 'the humiliating\\nand dangerous situation' of the presence of French schools and missions.\\nThere, for many years, French missioners had done the same work as\\nAmericans in Armenia, work in every sense liberal and civilising, but\\nundenominational in religious matters and unproselytising. That came to\\nan end earlier than the organisations in Armenia, and in Syria now, as\\nover the rest of the Turkish people, Arabs and Jews and Greeks have\\nnothing except German influence and Kultur to stand between them and the\\nspirit of Turkish progress of which the Armenian massacres were the\\nlatest epiphany. Germany, as we have seen, stood by and let the Armenian\\nmassacres go on, professing herself unable to interfere in the internal\\naffairs of Turkey, though at the time there was not a single branch of\\nTurkish industries, railways, telegraphs, armies, navies over which she\\nhad not complete control, exercising it precisely as she thought fit.\\n\\nIt is useless, then, to base any confidence in the safety of Jews,\\nGreeks, and Arabs from suffering the same fate as the Armenians, on a\\nveto from Germany. If it suits Germany to let those unfortunate peoples\\nbe murdered or deported to agricultural colonies, Germany will assuredly\\nnot stir a finger on their behalf nor prevent a repetition of the\\nhorrors I have dealt with in the previous chapter. Sooner than risk her\\nhold over Turkey by enforcing unacceptable demands, she will, unless\\nother considerations of self-interest determine her, let further\\nmassacres occur, if Talaat Bey insists on them. That spokesman of her\\npolicy, Ernst Marre, makes this perfectly explicit in his book, _Die\\nTuerken und Wir nach dem Kriege_, upholding from the German standpoint\\nthe right of Turkey and the wisdom of Turkey in dealing with her subject\\npeoples as she had dealt with the Armenians. 'The Turkish State,' he\\ntells us, 'is no united whole: Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, Kurds,\\ncannot be welded together.' (This, by a somewhat grim and ominous\\ncoincidence, is in exact accordance with a remark made to a Danish Red\\nCross Sister by a Turkish gendarme then engaged in massacring Armenians:\\n'First we get rid of the Armenians,' he said, 'then the Greeks, then the\\nKurds.') Or again, in defence of the Armenian massacres, 'Only by\\nenergetic interference and by expelling of the obstinate Armenian\\nelement, could the Ottoman Empire get rid of a Russian dominion.' Or\\nagain, 'The non-Turkish population of the Ottoman Empire must be\\nOttomanised.' Here, then, is the German point of view: the Ottoman\\nGovernment will be right to 'dispose of' its subject peoples as it\\nthinks fit. So far from interfering, Germany endorses, and German\\ninfluence to-day is all that stands between 'the murderous tyranny' and\\nits subject peoples. French, English, and finally American pressure can\\nno longer, since the entry of these nations into the war, be exercised\\nwithin the frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, and the only protection of\\ndefenceless aliens is the German Government. It did not stir a finger to\\nsave the Armenians, until it saw that depopulation threatened the\\nprosperity of its industries, and it is idle to expect that it will do\\nmore if the consolidation of Turkish supremacy demands a further\\ncampaign of murder. Greeks, Arabs, and Jews are all completely at the\\nmercy of Talaat's murder-schedules. The only chance that can save them\\nis that further extermination may not suit Germany's political aims,\\nand that she may find it worth her while to be peremptory, and forbid\\ninstead of endorsing.\\n\\nThere are unhappily many signs that the butchers of Constantinople are\\nplanning further massacres. In February of this year preliminary\\nmeasures were begun against the Greeks settled in Anatolia. Many were\\nforcibly proselytised, their property was confiscated, and they were\\nforbidden to carry on their businesses. Deportations also occurred, and\\nall Greeks were removed from many villages in Anatolia, into the\\ninterior, presumably to 'agricultural colonies' such as those provided\\nfor Armenians. They suffered terribly from hunger and exposure, and it\\nis estimated that ten per cent. of them died on their marches. Since\\nthen, however, there has been no more heard of any extension of those\\nmeasures, and there seems to have been as yet no massacre of Greeks. It\\nis reasonable to infer that Germany has in this case intervened. She\\nstill hoped to win Greece over to the Central European Powers, and\\nclearly any massacre of Greeks by her own Allies was not desirable.\\nKing Constantine, among his endless vacillations and pusillanimous\\ntreacheries, probably made a firm protest on the subject. But in the\\nkaleidoscope of war, should Greece come to the side of the Allies, it\\nseems most probable that there will occur a wholesale massacre of\\nGreeks. From what we know of the principles on which German Kultur is\\nbased, the most optimistic can scarcely hope that the very faintest\\nremonstrance will emanate from Berlin.\\n\\nThe case of the Arabs in Syria is even more precarious. From the moment\\nthat the policy of the Young Turks was evolved, namely, to consolidate\\nOsmanli supremacy by the weakening of its subject peoples, the Ottoman\\nGovernment has been waiting for its opportunity to get rid of the 'Arab\\nmenace.' As we have seen, they began by substituting Turkish for Arabic\\nas a written language in all official usages from the printing of the\\nKoran and the prayers for the Sultan down to the legends on railway\\ntickets. The Arab spirit, according to one of the spokesmen of the New\\nTurk party, had to be suppressed, the Arab lands had to become Turkish\\ncolonies. 'It is a peculiarly imperious necessity of our existence,' we\\nread in Jelal Noury Bey's propaganda, 'to Turkise the Arab lands, for\\nthe particularistic idea of nationality is awaking among the younger\\ngenerations of Arabs, and already threatens us with a great\\ncatastrophe.' Against the Arabs the Young Turks formed and fostered a\\nspecial animosity; they were powerful and warlike, and Enver, Talaat,\\nand others saw that the idea of an Osmanli supremacy could never be\\nrealised unless very drastic measures were taken against them. The\\ntenets of Islamism, it is true, forbade Moslems to fight Moslems, but\\nIslamism, as a binding force, was already obsolete in the counsels of\\nthe new regime, having given place to Kultur. Of all their subject\\npeoples, the Young Turks hated the Arabs the most, and, had not the\\nEuropean War intervened, there is no doubt that the Armenian massacres,\\nalready being planned, would have been followed by Arab massacres. But\\nthe armed and warlike Arabian tribes were not so easy to deal with as\\nthe defenceless Armenians, and Turkish troops could not be spared in\\nsufficient numbers to render an Arab massacre the safe, pleasant, and\\nlucrative pursuit that massacres should be. But Jemal the Great, black\\nwith his triumph over the Armenians at Zeitun, was Military Governor of\\nSyria, and, the Armenian question being solved, he began to get to work\\non the Arab question. Owing to the expulsion of the French Missions from\\nSyria in 1914, we have no such full or detailed information as we have\\nfrom Americans in Armenia, and the following account is mainly derived\\nfrom the Arabic journal _Mokattam,_ published in Cairo, the information\\nin which is based on the account given by a Syrian refugee. It agrees\\nwith pieces of evidence that have come to hand from other sources.\\n\\nEver since the beginning of the war Syria has been an area of direst\\npoverty, starvation, and sickness, which have been the natural\\nco-operators in Jemal's policy there. All supplies have been\\ncommandeered for the troops (including by special clause from Potsdam,\\nthe German troops); even fish caught by the fishermen of Lebanon have\\nto be handed over to the military authorities, and the shortage of\\nsupplies in Smyrna, for instance, is such that at the end of 1916 there\\nwere two hundred deaths daily from sheer starvation, while Germany was\\nimporting from Turkey hundreds of tons of corn and of meat. Thus this\\nwas no natural shortage, for though supplies were low all over the\\nTurkish Empire, there was not dearth of that kind. It was an artificial\\nshortage made possible by German demands, and made intentional by\\nJemal's policy. Beirut was in no better case than Smyrna; Lebanon\\nperhaps was in sorer straits than either. Money was equally scarce, and\\nit fitted Jemal's policy that this should be so, for when Americans in\\nBeirut had raised funds in America for the relief of the destitute, the\\nTurkish Government forbade their distribution. Arabs and Greeks were\\ndying by the hundred all over the provinces, and the beneficent decrees\\nof nature must not be interfered with. In the streets of towns the poor\\nhave been fighting over scraps of sugarcane and orange peel; in the\\ncountry, to quote from _Molcattam_, 'no sooner do wild plants and beans\\nstart to grow than the fields are filled with women and children who\\npick them and use them as food.' Except for military purposes (including\\nthe victualling of German troops) transportation has ceased to exist,\\nand this, too, was part of the policy of Jemal the Great.\\n\\nOn the heels of famine, like a hound behind a huntsman, came typhus. In\\nthe province of Aleppo before the summer of 1916, over 8000 persons had\\ndied of it. Doctors and medicines were unobtainable, for all were\\nrequisitioned for the needs of the army, and in Damascus and Tripoli, in\\nHama and Homs, the epidemic spread like a forest fire. No help was sent\\nfrom Constantinople, none was permitted to be brought by the charitable\\nfrom abroad, for famine and pestilence among the Arabs were working for\\nthe policy of Jemal the Great. There were no troops to spare who should\\nhasten on the work, but the work was progressing by swift and 'natural'\\nmeans. Hunger and pestilence--behold the finger of Allah the God of\\nLove! How superior He showed Himself to the discarded Allah of the\\nArabs. 'Ring down the curtain,' said Jemal the Great, 'and let no news\\nof the ways of Allah get abroad!' So a strict surveillance was\\nestablished on the coast, all boats were chained to the shore, and if\\nany attempted to swim out to ships of the Allied nations which passed,\\nthe coast guards had orders to shoot him down. Too much news about\\nArmenian massacres filtered through; there should not now be such\\nleakage. And when starvation and pestilence had firmly established\\nthemselves, Jemal the Great went down to see what his personal exertions\\ncould effect. All was working in accordance with his plan; the poorer\\nclasses of Arabs were dying like flies, but mortality was not so\\nsuccessful among the wealthier, who could, to some extent, purchase\\nfood. So Jemal the Great set to work among them. He began by hanging the\\nheads of Syrian-Arabs in Damascus, Beirut, and other cities. No\\nsemblance of trial, no prosecution or arraignment, were necessary: he\\nestablished courts-martial under military control, made lists of the\\naccused, and ordered the courts-martial to condemn them to death.\\nSometimes he made mistakes, appointing as the members of his\\ncourt-martial men who were not such sturdy patriots as he, and refused\\nto sentence for no crime the accused whom he nominated. He remedied such\\nmistakes by appointing new boards of more seasoned stuff. Moslem and\\nChristian alike were brought before them, and a general accusation of\\npro-French tendencies seems to have been sufficient to secure a sentence\\nof death or lifelong imprisonment. He aimed not at the poor and the\\nobscure, for whom hunger and pestilence were providing, but at the rich\\nand the influential. The higher clergy in Christian circles, Bishops and\\nMonsignors, were a favourite target, and among Moslems influential\\nSheikhs. Sometimes there was a parody of a trial; sometimes the parody\\nwas dispensed with, and when the black curtain was last raised over\\nSyria, Jemal the Great had disposed of over eight hundred of the heads\\nof the most influential of Syrian Arabs. He had got rid, in fact, of\\nthe whole House of Lords, and something more. Those who are acquainted\\nwith 'feudal values' among the Arabs will understand what that means. He\\ndecapitated, not individuals only, but groups. For devilish ingenuity in\\nthis combination of starvation and pestilence for the poor, and death or\\nlifelong imprisonment for the chiefs, Jemal the Great must take rank\\nwith Abdul Hamid and the contrivers of the Armenian massacres. He\\ncannot, it is true, owing to lack of troops, obtain the swift results of\\nEnver in Armenia, but between typhus, starvation, and courts-martial,\\nhis solution of the Arab question in Syria is making steady progress.\\nAnd those measures, hideously efficient in themselves, are, beyond any\\ndoubt whatever, only the precursors of more sweeping exterminations of\\nthe Arab race, which will be effected after the war, if the Allied\\nPowers do not step in to save it. The Faithful of the Holy City, Mecca,\\nhave revolted and thrown off the Turkish yoke, and while the war lasts,\\nand Turkish troops are otherwise occupied under Teutonic supervision,\\nthey will be able to maintain their independence, for there is no\\nconsiderable body of Turks which can seriously threaten them. But the\\nSyrian Arabs, so long as the war lasts, are being, and will be, the\\nvictims of a quiet scheme of extermination, which, if long continued,\\nwill be as complete as that devised and carried out by the butchers of\\nConstantinople for the peoples of Armenia. It is not in the interest of\\nthe Germans to save them, and no check is being put on Jemal the Great\\nto hinder him from assisting starvation and typhus to ravage the\\ncountry, and supplementing their deadly work by court-martial without\\ntrial.\\n\\nEqually significant of the rage for the destruction of Arabs was the\\ntreatment of the Bagdad Arab army corps. In spite of the need for troops\\none half of it was sent from Bagdad to Erzerum in the depth of winter,\\nwithout any provision of warm clothing. There, in those cold uplands,\\nthe men died at the rate of fifty to sixty a day. Their commanding\\nofficer was a Turk, and a creature of Enver's, called Abdul Kader.\\nThough these troops had fought admirably, he openly called them Arab\\ntraitors, and his orders seem to have been merely to get rid of them.\\nThere were no courts-martial; they were just taken into a climate which\\nkilled them.\\n\\nWhile for the last thirty years the Armenians and Syrians have emigrated\\nin large numbers from the Ottoman Empire, there has been a large\\nimmigration of Jews into it. This movement was originally due to the\\npersecution they suffered in Russia. Germany and Austria were closed to\\nthem, and, flying from the hideous pogroms that threatened them with\\nextermination, they begun to settle in Palestine. Wealthy compatriots\\nsuch as Baron Edmond de Rothschild assisted them, and, with the amazing\\nversatility of their race, they, trades-people and town-folk, adapted\\nthemselves to new conditions, turned their wits towards husbandry and\\nagriculture, and during the last thirty years have flourished and\\nmultiplied in a manner quite unrealised by the western world. In 1881\\nthere were not more than 25,000 of them in the home of their race, but\\nby the beginning of the European War, when their immigration ceased for\\nthe present, they numbered 120,000 souls. Till then the Ottoman\\nGovernment adopted the ancient Turkish policy of neglect towards them,\\nfor they were not powerful enough numerically to earn the honour of a\\nmassacre, and, in addition, they were useful settlers. Backed by\\npowerful Western influence, French, English, and German alike, they\\nimproved out of knowledge the values of the lands where they established\\nthemselves, and by intelligent management, by conserving and increasing\\nthe water supply with irrigation and well-digging, they have brought\\nmany thousand acres into cultivation. Originally refugees, fleeing from\\noutrageous persecutions, their immigration by degrees took on a\\ndifferent spirit. Not only were they coming out of captivity, but they\\nwere entering into the ancient Land of Promise again. Zionism, the\\nspirit of the returning exiles, animated them, and, according to their\\nprophets, they realised that 'The Lord shall comfort Zion, He shall\\ncomfort all her waste places.' They had sowed in tears; now, on their\\nreturn, they were reaping in joy, and, though their land was still\\nunder the infidel yoke, they were allowed to dwell in peace, busy,\\nindustrious, with the halo of home-coming in their hearts. They paid, of\\ncourse, their Turkish taxes, but these were not levied in any oppressive\\nmanner, and their colonies were thrifty, self-governing, and prosperous.\\nAlready before the war, one-tenth of the cultivated land in Palestine\\nwas in their hands, they had their own schools, their own methods of\\norganisation, and, more significant than all, Hebrew became a living\\nlanguage again. Germany, intent on her penetration of Turkey, made an\\nattempt to Germanise them also (for Germany, as we shall see, has a very\\nspecial interest in these Jewish colonies), shook her head over Zionism,\\nfor which she tried to substitute Prussianism, and wanted to make the\\nGerman language compulsory in Jewish schools at Haifa and Jaffa, but her\\neffort completely failed. Nothing could show the inherent vitality of\\nthis Jewish colonisation more strikingly.\\n\\nThese Jewish settlers then were left in peace; from minuteness they\\nescaped the notice of the Young Turk party in its schemes for the\\ncomplete Ottomanisation of the Empire, and, until the present year 1917,\\nno mention of 'the Jewish question' was propounded. But it will he\\nremembered that in 1915, certain Jewish refugees, taking warning from\\nthe Armenian massacres, fled to Egypt, and there founded a Zionist\\nmule-corps, which served under the English in the Gallipoli campaign. It\\nseems very probable that it was this that directed the attention of\\nJemal the Great to the Jewish colonies in Palestine: possibly it was\\nmerely that he was a more thorough Ottomaniser than his colleagues in\\nConstantinople. In any case he ordered the 'deportation' of all Jews\\nfrom Jaffa, Gaza, and other agricultural districts. All Jews were\\ncommanded to leave Jaffa within forty-eight hours, no means of transport\\nwas given them, and they were forbidden to take with them either\\nprovisions or any of their belongings. Eight thousand Jews were evicted\\nfrom Jaffa alone, and their houses were pillaged, and they robbed,\\nmaltreated, and many were murdered. Thus, and in no other way had the\\nmassacres of the Armenians begun, and, that there should be no mistake\\nabout it, Jemal threatened them explicitly with the fate of the\\nArmenians. Next day Ludd was evacuated also; the evacuation of Haifa and\\nJerusalem was threatened, and artillery was sent to Jerusalem. There can\\nbe no doubt in fact that Jemal planned and began to carry out a massacre\\nof all Jews.\\n\\nAt that point the Germans intervened, and for the present (but only for\\nthe present, for so long in fact as Germany has complete control over\\nall Turkish internal affairs, in which she protested she could not\\nmeddle) the Jewish colonies in Palestine seem to be safe.[1] The German\\nchief of the General Staff telegraphed to Berlin that the 'military\\nconsiderations' on which Jemal based his deportations did not exist, and\\nHerr Cohn in the Reichstag drew the Imperial Chancellor's attention to\\nthis. How seriously the menace was regarded in Germany, and how far the\\ndeportations had gone may be gathered from his words, 'Is the Imperial\\nChancellor prepared to influence the Turkish Government in such a manner\\nas to prevent with certainty--so far as this is still possible--a\\nrepetition in Palestine of the Armenian atrocities?' This was\\nsufficient: Germany, who could not dream of interfering in Turkish\\ninternal affairs when only the massacre of hundreds of thousands of\\nArmenians was concerned, sent her order, and, for the present, Jemal the\\nGreat has been unable to proceed with the solution of the Jewish\\nquestion in Turkey, which he had just discovered. We need not yet in\\nfact give Jemal his Jew. But some sort of explanation to soothe the\\nexasperation of the Turks in not being allowed to murder when and how\\nand where they pleased, was thought advisable, and the explanation (an\\nextraordinarily significant one) was given in an inspired paragraph of\\nthe _Frankfurter Zeitung_ not long after. 'The valuable structure of\\nZionist cultural work, in which the German Empire must have well founded\\ninterest in view of future and very promising trade relations, will, it\\nis very much to be hoped, be preserved from destruction so far as purely\\nmilitary requirements do not make it necessary. Pan-Turkish ideals have\\nno sort of meaning in Palestine where practically no Turks dwell.'\\n\\n[Footnote 1: This view seems to be borne out by subsequent events, for\\nthe Jews evacuated from Jaffa have been permitted to return owing to the\\nintervention of the Spanish Government. It is not hard to guess who\\nprompted that.]\\n\\nWe may take it, then, that with regard to the projected Jewish\\nmassacres, quite clearly foreshadowed by the schemes of deportation from\\nJaffa and Gaza, Germany has made strong representations to the Ottoman\\nGovernment. She did not do so (indeed she officially refused to do so)\\nwhen the Armenian massacres began, for she could not interfere in\\nTurkey's internal affairs. But now she has discovered that Pan-Turkish\\nideals have no sort of meaning in Palestine, and thus, with amazing\\nastuteness, has provided herself with a reason for interfering, while\\nstill not giving up the policy of non-interference in Turkish affairs,\\nfor Turkey, she has discovered, _has_ no affairs in Palestine. At the\\nsame time she guards herself from diplomatic defeat by the hope that\\nZionist cultural work will be saved from destruction so _far as purely\\nmilitary requirements do not make it necessary_. In other words,\\nsupposing Jemal the Great got completely out of hand, and proceeded to\\nindiscriminate massacre of the Jews, Germany would doubtless accept his\\nplea that military requirements had made it necessary.... And we were\\nonce so ignorant as to assure ourselves that Germany had no notions of\\ndiplomacy!\\n\\nThe full significance of her intervention on behalf of the Jews, when\\nneither the extermination of the Armenians, the persecution of the\\nArabs, nor the deportation of the Greeks moved Germany to any decided\\naction or energetic protest, must be left, in so far as it concerns the\\nfuture, to another chapter. But as regards the present and the past it\\nwill be useful to consider here what has prompted her to make a protest\\n(which we may regard, so long as her foot is on the neck of the Turks,\\nas having been successful) against these projected massacres. Certainly\\nit was not humanity; it was not the faintest desire to save innocent\\npeople in general from being murdered wholesale, for in the similar\\ncase of the Armenians, her bowels of compassion were not moved. Or,\\npossibly, if we incline to lenience, we may say that she was sorry for\\nthe Armenians, but could not then risk a disagreement with their\\nmurderers who were her allies, whereas now, feeling herself more\\ncompletely dominant over the Turks than she then did, she could risk\\nbeing peremptory, especially since there was that saving clause about\\nmilitary requirements. For during the Armenian massacres, the\\nDardanelles expedition was still on the shores of Gallipoli, and the\\nmenace to Constantinople acute. It was possible that if she opposed a\\nfirm front to the Armenian massacres, the Turks, already on the verge of\\ndespair with regard to saving the capital from capture, might have made\\nterms with the Allies. But now no such imminence of danger threatened\\nthem, and, with Germany's domination over them vastly more secure than\\nit had been in 1915, she could afford to treat them less as allies and\\nmore as a conquered people. This alone might have accounted for her\\nunprecedented impulse of humanity in the minds of those who still\\nattribute such instincts to her, but she had far stronger reasons than\\nthat for wanting to save the Jews of Palestine.\\n\\nHer policy with regard to them is set forth in a pamphlet by Dr. Davis\\nTreitsch, called _Die Jueden der Tuerkei_, published in 1915, which is a\\nmost illuminating little document. These Jewish colonies, as we have\\nseen, came from Russia, and as Germany realised, long before the war,\\nthey might easily form a German nucleus in the Near East, for they\\nlargely consisted of German-speaking Jews, akin in language and blood to\\na most important element in her own population. 'In a certain sense,'\\nsays Dr. Treitsch, 'the Jews are a Near Eastern element in Germany and a\\nGerman element in Turkey.' He goes on with unerring acumen to lament the\\nexodus of German-speaking Jews to the United States and to England.\\n'Annually some 100,000 of these are lost to Germany, the empire of the\\nEnglish language and the economic system that goes with it is being\\nenlarged, while a German asset is being proportionately depreciated....\\nIt will no longer do simply to close the German frontiers to them, and\\nin view of the difficulties which would result from a wholesale\\nmigration of Jews into Germany itself, Germans will only be too glad to\\nfind a way out in the emigration of those Jews to Turkey--a solution\\nextraordinarily favourable to the interests of all three parties\\nconcerned.'\\n\\nHere, then, is the matter in a nutshell: Germany, wide-awake as ever,\\nsaw long ago the advantage to her of a growing Jewish population from\\nthe Pale in Turkey. She was perhaps a little overloaded with them\\nherself, but in this immigration from Russia to Palestine she saw the\\nformation of a colony that was well worth German protection, and the\\nresult of the war, provided the Palestinian immigrants were left in\\npeace, would be to augment very largely the number of those settling\\nthere. 'Galicia,' says Dr. Treitsch, 'and the western provinces of\\nRussia, which between them contain more than half the Jews in the world,\\nhave suffered more from the war than any other region. Jewish homes\\nhave been broken up by hundreds of thousands, and there is no doubt\\nwhatever that, as a result of the war, there will be an emigration of\\nEast European Jews on an unprecedented scale.' This emigration, then, to\\nPalestine was, in Germany's view, a counter-weight to the 100,000\\nannually lost to her through emigration to America and England. With her\\nfoot on Turkey's neck she had control over these German-speaking Jews,\\nand saw in them the elements of a German colony. Her calculations, it is\\ntrue, were somewhat upset by the development of the Zionist movement, by\\nwhich those settlers declared themselves to have a nationality of their\\nown, and a language of their own, and Dr. Treitsch concedes that. 'But,'\\nhe adds, 'in addition to Hebrew, to which they are more and more\\ninclined, the Jews must have a world-language, and this can only be\\nGerman.'\\n\\nThis, then, in brief, and only up to the present, is the story of how\\nthe Jewish massacres were stayed. The Jews were potential Germans, and\\nGermany, who sat by with folded hands when Arabs and Armenians were led\\nto torture and death, put up a warning finger, and, for the present,\\nsaved them. In her whole conduct of the war, nothing has been more\\ncharacteristic than her 'verboten' to one projected massacre and her\\nacquiescence in others. But, as for her having saved the Jews out of\\nmotives of humanity, 'Credant Judaei!'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Chapter V_\\n\\n\\nDEUTSCHLAND UeBER ALLAH\\n\\nIt was commonly said at the beginning of this war that, whatever\\nGermany's military resources might be, she was hopelessly and childishly\\nlacking in diplomatic ability and in knowledge of psychology, from which\\nall success in diplomacy is distilled. As instances of this grave\\ndefect, people adduced the fact that, apparently, she had not\\nanticipated the entry of Great Britain into the war at all, while her\\ntreatment of Belgium immediately afterwards was universally pronounced\\nto be not a crime merely, but a blunder of the stupidest sort. It is\\nperfectly true that Germany did not understand, and, as seems likely in\\nthe light of innumerable other atrocities, never will understand, the\\npsychology of civilised peoples; she has never shown any signs up till\\nnow, at any rate, of 'having got the hang of it' at all. But critics of\\nher diplomacy failed to see the root-fact that she did not understand it\\nmerely because it did not interest her. It was not worth her while to\\nmaster the psychology of other civilised nations, since she was out not\\nto understand them, but to conquer them. She had all the information she\\nwanted about their armies and navies and guns and ammunition neatly and\\ncorrectly tabulated. Why, then, since this was all that concerned her,\\nshould she cram her head with irrelevant information about what they\\nmight feel on the subject of gas-attacks or the torpedoing of neutral\\nships without warning? As long as her fumes were deadly and her\\nsubmarines subtle, nothing further concerned her.\\n\\nBut Europe generally made a great mistake in supposing that Germany\\ncould not learn psychology, and the process of its distillation into\\ndiplomacy when it interested her. The psychology of the French and\\nEnglish was a useless study, for she was merely going to fight them, but\\nfor years she had been studying with an industry and a patience that\\nput our diplomacy to shame (as was most swiftly and ignominiously proven\\nwhen it came into conflict with hers) the psychology of the Turks. For\\nyears she had watched the dealings of the Great Powers with Turkey, but\\nshe had never really associated herself with that policy. She sat\\nquietly by and saw how it worked. Briefly it was this. For a hundred\\nyears Turkey had been kept alive in Europe by the sedulous attentions of\\nthe Physician Powers, who dared not let him die for fear of the\\nstupendous quarrels which would instantly arise over his corpse. So\\nthere they all sat round his bed, and kept him alive with injections of\\nstrychnine and oxygen, and, no less, by a policy of rousing and\\nirritating the patient. All through the reign of Abdul Hamid they\\npersevered: Great Britain plucked his pillow from him, so to speak, by\\nher protectorate of Egypt; Russia tweaked Eastern Rumelia from him;\\nFrance deprived him of his hot-water bottle when she snatched at the\\nConstantinople quays, and they all shook and slapped him when he went to\\nwar with Greece in 1896, and instantly deprived him of the territory he\\nhad won in Thessaly. That was the principle of European diplomacy\\ntowards Turkey, and from it Germany always held aloof.\\n\\nBut from about the beginning of the reign of the present German Emperor,\\nGerman or rather Prussian diplomacy had been going quietly about its\\nwork. It was worth while to study the psychology of the Turks, because\\ndimly then, but with ever-increasing distinctness, Germany foresaw that\\nTurkey might be a counter of immense importance in the great conflict\\nwhich was assuredly drawing nearer, though as yet its existence was but\\nforeshadowed by the most distant reflections of summer lightning on a\\nserene horizon. But if Turkey was to be of any profit to her, she wanted\\na strong Turkey who could fight with her (or rather for her), and she\\nhad no use for the Sick Man whom the other Powers were bent on keeping\\nalive, but no more. Her own eventual domination of Turkey was always the\\nend in view, but she wanted to dominate not a weak but a strong servant.\\nAnd her diplomacy was not less than brilliant simply from the fact that\\non the one hand it soothed Turkey instead of irritating, and, on the\\nother, that it went absolutely unnoticed for a long time. Nobody knew\\nthat it was going on. She sent officers to train the Turkish army, well\\nknowing what magnificent material Anatolia afforded, and she had\\nthoroughly grasped the salient fact that to make any way with Oriental\\npeoples your purse must be open and your backshish unlimited. 'There is\\nno God but backshish, and the Deutsche Bank is his prophet.'\\n\\nFor years this went on very quietly, and all over the great field of the\\nOttoman Empire the first tiny blades of the crop that Germany was sowing\\nbegan to appear. To-day that crop waves high, and covers the whole field\\nwith its ripe and fruitful ears. For to-day Turkey is neither more nor\\nless than a German colony, and more than makes up to her for the\\ncolonies she has lost and hopes to regain. She knows that perfectly\\nwell, and so do any who have at all studied the history and the results\\nof her diplomacy there. Even Turkey itself must, as in an uneasy dream,\\nbe faintly conscious of it. For who to-day is the Sultan of Turkey? No\\nother than William II. of Germany. It is in Berlin that his Cabinet\\nmeets, and sometimes he asks Talaat Bey to attend in a strictly honorary\\ncapacity. And Talaat Bey goes back to Constantinople with a strictly\\nhonorary sword of honour. Or else he gives one to William II. from his\\n_soi-disant_ master, the Sultan, or takes one back to his _soi-disant_\\nmaster from his real master. For no one knows better than William II.\\nthe use that swords of honour play in deeds of dishonour.\\n\\nThe object of this chapter is to trace and mount the hewn and solid\\nstaircase of steps by which Germany's present supremacy over Turkey was\\nachieved.\\n\\nApart from the quiet spade-work that had been going on for some years,\\nGermany made no important move till the moment when, in 1909, the Young\\nTurk party, after the forced abdication of Abdul Hamid, proclaimed the\\naims and ideals of the new regime. At once Germany saw her opportunity,\\nfor here, with her help, might arise the strong Turkey which she\\ndesired to see, instead of the weak Turkey which all the other European\\nPowers had been keeping on a lowering diet for so long (desirous only\\nthat it should not quite expire), and from that moment she began to\\nlend, or rather let, to Turkey in ever-increasing quantities, the\\nresources of her scientific and her military knowledge. It was in her\\ninterests, if Turkey was to be of use to her, that she should educate,\\nand irrigate, and develop the unexploited treasures of human material,\\nof fertility and mineral wealth; and Germany's gold, her schools, her\\nlaboratories were at Turkey's disposal. But in every case she, as in\\nduty bound to her people, saw that she got very good value for her\\noutlay.\\n\\nHere, then, was the great psychological moment when Germany instantly\\nmoved. The Young Turks proclaimed that they were going to weld the\\nOttoman Empire into one homogeneous and harmonious whole, and by a piece\\nof brilliant paradoxical reasoning Germany determined that it was she\\nwho was going to do it for them. In flat contradiction of the spirit of\\ntheir manifestoes, which proclaimed the Pan-Turkish ideal, she conceived\\nand began to carry out under their very noses the great new chapter of\\nthe Pan-Germanic ideal. And the Young Turks did not know the difference!\\nThey mistook that lusty Teutonic changeling for their own new-born\\nTurkish babe, and they nursed and nourished it. Amazingly it throve, and\\nsoon it cut its teeth, and one day, when they thought it was asleep, it\\narose from its cradle a baby no more, but a great Prussian guardsman who\\nshouted, 'Deutschland ueber Allah!'\\n\\nOnly once was there a check in the growth of the Prussian infant, and\\nthat was no more than a childish ailment. For when the Balkan wars broke\\nout the Turkish army was in the transitional stage. Its German tutors\\nhad not yet had time to inspire the army with German discipline and\\ntradition; they had only weeded out, so to speak, the old Turkish\\nspirit, the blind obedience to the Ministers of the Shadow of God. The\\nShadow of God, in fact, in the person of the Sultan, had been dragged\\nout into the light, and his Shadow had grown appreciably less. In\\nconsequence there was not at this juncture any cohesion in the army, and\\nit suffered reverse after reverse. But a strong though a curtailed\\nTurkey was more in accordance with Prussian ideas than a weak and\\nsprawling one, and Germany bore the Turkish defeats very valiantly. And\\nthat was the only set-back that this Pan-Prussian youngster experienced,\\nand it was no more than an attack of German measles which he very\\nquickly got over. For two or three years German influence wavered, then\\nrecovered, 'with blessings on the falling out, that all the more\\nendears.'\\n\\nIt is interesting to see how Germany adapted the Pan-Turkish ideal to\\nher own ends, and, by a triumphant vindication of Germany's methods, the\\nbest account of this Pan-Turkish ideal is to be found in a publication\\nof 1915 by Tekin Alp, which was written as German propaganda and by\\nGermany disseminated broadcast over the Turkish Empire. An account of\\nthis movement has already been given in Chapter II., as far as the\\nTurkish side of it is concerned, and it remains only to enumerate the\\nGerman contribution to the fledging of this new Turkish Phoenix. The\\nTurkish language and the Turkish Allah, God of Love, in whose name the\\nArmenians were tortured and massacred, were the two wings on which it\\nwas to soar. Auxiliary soaring societies were organised, among them a\\nTurkish Ojagha with similar aims, and no fewer than sixteen branches of\\nit were founded throughout the Empire. There were also a Turkish Guiji\\nor gymnastic club, and an Izji or boy scouts' club. A union of merchants\\nworked for the same object in districts where hitherto trade had been in\\nthe hands of Greeks and Armenians, and signs appeared on their shops\\nthat only Turkish labour was employed. Religious funds also were used\\nfor similar economic restoration.\\n\\nGermany saw, Germany tabulated, Germany licked her lips and took out her\\nlong spoon, for her hour was come. She did not interfere: she only\\nhelped to further the Pan-Turkish ideal. With her usual foresight she\\nperceived that the Izji, for instance, was a thing to encourage, for\\nthe boys who were being trained now would in a few years be precisely\\nthe young men of whom she could not have too many. By all means the boy\\nscout movement was to be encouraged. She encouraged it so generously and\\nmethodically that in 1916, according to an absolutely reliable source of\\ninformation, we find that the whole boy scout movement, with its\\ninnumerable branches, was under the control of a German officer, Colonel\\nvon Hoff. In its classes (derneks) boys are trained in military\\npractices, in 'a recreational manner,' so that they enjoy--positively\\nenjoy (a Prussian touch)--the exercises that will fit them to be of use\\nto the Sultan William II. They learn trigger-drill, they learn\\nskirmishing, they are taught to make reports on the movements of their\\ncompanies, they are shown neat ways of judging distances. They are\\ndivided into two classes, the junior class ranging from the ages of\\ntwelve to seventeen, the senior class consisting of boys over seventeen,\\nbut not yet of military age. But since Colonel von Hoff organised this,\\nthe military age has been extended, and boys of seventeen have got to\\nserve their country on German fronts. Prussian thoroughness, therefore,\\nsaw that their training must begin earlier; the old junior class has\\nbecome the senior class, and a new junior class has been set on foot\\nwhich begins its recreational exercises in the service of William II.,\\nGot and Allah, at the age of eight. It is all great fun, but those\\npigeon-livered little boys who are not diverted by it have to go on with\\ntheir fun all the same, for, needless to say, the Izji is compulsory on\\nall boys. Of course they wear a uniform which is made in Germany and is\\nof a 'semi-military' character.\\n\\nThe provision of soldiers and sailors, then, trained from the early age\\nof eight, was the first object of Germany's peaceful and benign\\npenetration. As from the Pisgah height of the Pan-Turkish ideal she saw\\nthe promised land, but she had no idea of seeing it only, like Moses,\\nand expiring without entering it, and her faith that she would enter it\\nand possess it and organise it has been wonderfully justified. She has\\nnot only penetrated, but has dominated; a year ago towns like Aleppo\\nwere crammed with German officers, while at Islahie there were separate\\nwooden barracks for the exclusive use of German troops. There is a\\nmilitary mission at Mamoura, where all the buildings are permanent\\nerections solidly built of stone, for no merely temporary occupation is\\nintended, and thousands of freight-cars with Belgian marks upon them\\nthrong the railways, and on some is the significant German title of\\n'Military Headquarters of the Imperial Staff.' There are troops in the\\nTurkish army, to which is given the title of 'Pasha formation,' in\\ncompliment to Turkey, but the Pasha formations are under command of\\nBaron Kress von Kressenstein, and are salted with German officers,\\nN.C.O.'s, and privates, who, although in the Turkish army, retain their\\nGerman uniforms.\\n\\nThis German leaven forms an instructional class for the remainder of the\\ntroops in these formations, who are Turkish. The Germans are urged to\\nrespect Moslem customs and to show particular consideration for their\\nreligious observances. Every German contingent arriving at\\nConstantinople to join the Pasha formations finds quarters prepared on a\\nship, and when the troops leave for their 'destination' they take\\nsupplies from depots at the railway station which will last them two or\\nthree months. They are enjoined to write war diaries, and are provided\\nwith handbooks on the military and geographical conditions in\\nMesopotamia, with maps, and with notes on the training and management of\\ncamels. This looks as if they were intended for use against the English\\ntroops in Mesopotamia, but I cannot find that they have been identified\\nthere. The greatest secrecy is observed with regard to those Pasha\\nformations, and their constitution and movements are kept extremely well\\nveiled.\\n\\nWireless stations have been set up in Asia Minor and Palestine, and\\nthese are under the command of Major Schlee. A Turkish air-service was\\ninstituted, at the head of which was Major Serno, a Prussian officer,\\nand Turkish aviators are now in training at Ostend, where they will very\\nusefully defend their native country. At Constantinople there is a\\nnaval school for Turkish engineers and mechanics in the arsenal, to help\\non the Pan-Turkish ideal, and with a view to that all the instructors\\nare German: a floating dock is in construction at Ismid, and the order\\nhas been placed with German firms. It will be capable of accommodating\\nships of Dreadnought build, which is a new departure for the strictly\\nPan-Turkish ideal. The cost is L740,000, to be repaid three years after\\nthe end of the war. Similarly, by the spring of this year, Germany had\\narranged to start submarine training in Constantinople for the Turks,\\nand a submarine school was open and at work in March. A few months later\\nit was established at the island of Prinkipo, where it is now hard at\\nwork under German instructors. Other naval cadets were sent to Germany\\nfor their training, and Turkish officers were present at the battle of\\nJutland in June 1916, and of course were decorated by the Emperor in\\nperson for their coolness and courage.[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: In October 1917 a bill was passed for the entire\\nremodelling of the Turkish fleet after the war, on the lines of the\\nGerman fleet, 'which proved its perfect training in the battle of Skager\\nRak.']\\n\\nA complete revision of the Turkish system of exemptions from military\\nservice was necessary as soon as Germany began to want men badly. The\\nage for military service was first raised, and we find a Turkish order\\nof October 1916, calling on all men of forty-three, forty-four, and\\nforty-five years of age to pay their exemption tax if they did not wish\\nto be called to the colours. That secured their money, and, with truly\\nPrussian irony, hardly had this been done when a fresh army order was\\nissued calling out all men, whether they had paid their exemption tax or\\nnot. Germany thus secured both their money and their lives.\\n\\nStill more men were needed, and in November a fresh levy of boys was\\nraised regardless of whether they had reached the military age or not.\\nThis absorbed the senior class of the boy scouts, who hitherto had\\nlearned their drill in a 'recreationary manner.' Neither Jews nor\\nChristians are exempt from service, and frequent press gangs go round\\nConstantinople rounding up those who are in hiding.\\n\\nAgain the Prussian Moloch was hungry for more, and in December 1916 the\\nTurkish _Gazette_ announced that all males in Asia Minor between the\\nages of fourteen and sixty-five were to be enrolled for military\\nservice, and in January of this year, 1917, fresh recruiting was\\nforeshadowed by the order that men of forty-six to fifty-two, who had\\npaid their exemption money, should be medically examined to see if they\\nwere fit for active service. This fresh recruiting was also put in force\\nin the case of boys, and during the summer of 1917 all boys above the\\nage of twelve, provided they were sound and well-built, were taken for\\nthe army. Wider and wider the net was spread, and in the same month a\\nfresh Turco-German convention was signed, whereby was enforced a\\nreciprocal surrender in both countries of persons liable to military\\nservice, and of deserters, and simultaneously all Turks living in\\nSwitzerland, and who had paid exemption money, were recalled to their\\nGermanised fatherland. By now the first crops of the year were ripening\\nin Smyrna, and in default of civilian labour (for every one was now a\\nsoldier) they were reaped by Turkish soldiers and the produce sent\\ndirect to Germany.\\n\\nAlready in August 1916, certificates of Ottoman nationality had been\\ngranted to Serbians resident in the Empire who were willing to become\\nOttoman subjects, and their 'willingness' was intensified by hints that\\nincidents akin to the Armenian massacres might possibly occur among\\nother alien peoples. They had to sign a declaration that they would not\\nrevert to their former nationality, and thus, no doubt, many Serbs\\npassed into the Turkish army. Further enrolments were desirable, and, in\\nMarch 1917, all Greeks living in Anatolia were forcibly proselytised,\\ntheir property was confiscated, and they were made liable to military\\nservice. Unfortunately all were not available, for of those who were\\nremoved from the villages where they lived to military centres, ten per\\ncent. died on the forced marches from hunger and exposure. That was\\nannoying for the German recruiting agents, but it suited well enough the\\nPan-Turkish ideal of exterminating foreign nationalities. When trouble\\nor discontent occurred among the troops, it was firmly dealt with, as,\\nfor instance, when, in November 1916, there were considerable desertions\\nfrom the 49th Division. On that occasion the order was given to fire on\\nthem, and many were killed and wounded. The officer who gave the order\\nwas commended by the Prussian authorities for his firmness. Should such\\nan incident occur again, it will no doubt be dealt with no less\\nfirmness, for, in April 1917, Mackensen was put in supreme command of\\nall troops in Asia Minor. But in spite of this desertions have largely\\nincreased lately, and during the summer deserters out of all the Turkish\\narmies were believed to number about 200,000. Many of those have formed\\nthemselves into brigand bands, who make the roads dangerous for\\ntravellers. The exchange of honours goes on, for not long ago, in\\nBerlin, Prince Zia-ed-Din, the Turkish Sultan's heir, presented a sword\\nof honour to the Sultan William II. Probably he gave him good news of\\nthe progress of the German harbour works begun in the winter at\\nStamboul, and himself learned that the railway bridge which the Turks\\nproposed to build over the Bosporus was not to be proceeded with, for\\nthe German high command had superseded that scheme by their own idea of\\nmaking a tunnel under the Bosporus instead, which would be safer from\\naircraft.\\n\\nSuch up-to-date, though in brief outline, is the history of the\\nestablishment of the Prussian octopus grip on military and naval matters\\nin Turkey. We have largely ourselves to blame for it. Upon that pathetic\\nand lamb-like record of our diplomacy during the months between the\\noutbreak of the European War, and the entry of Turkey into it in October\\n1914, it would be morbid to dwell at any length, though a short summary\\nis necessary. As we all know now, Turkey had concluded a treaty with\\nGermany early in August, and when our Ambassador in Constantinople, Sir\\nLouis Malet, who was on leave in England at that date, returned to his\\npost on August 16th, all that Turkey wanted was to gain time in which to\\neffect her mobilisation. This she did, with complete success, and our\\nAmbassador telegraphed to England stating his perfect confidence in the\\nsincerity with which the Grand Vizier professed his friendship for\\nEngland. All through those weeks of August and September this confidence\\nappeared to continue unabated. The Moderate party in Turkey--that is to\\nsay, the hoodwinking party--were reported to be daily gaining strength,\\nand it was most important that the Allies should give them every\\nassistance, and above all not precipitate matters. All was going well:\\nall we had to do was to wait. So we waited, still blindly confident in\\nthe sincerity of Turkey's friendship for England, while the mobilisation\\nof the Turkish forces proceeded merrily. By the end of September this\\nwas nearly complete, and quite suddenly the Ambassador informed the\\nForeign Office that Turkey appeared to be temporising. That was\\nperfectly true, but the period of temporisation was nearly over, and by\\nmid-October Turkey had something like 800,000 men under arms, and for\\nnine weeks Enver Pasha had had his signed treaty with Germany in his\\npocket. Possibly this diplomatic procrastination was useful to us, for\\nit enabled us to bring troops from India in security, and send others to\\nEgypt. But without doubt it was useful to the Turks, for it enabled them\\nto mobilise their armies, and to strengthen enormously the defences of\\nthe Dardanelles. Then came the day when Germany and Turkey were ready,\\nthe attack was made on Odessa, and out of Constantinople we went. We\\nclimbed into the railway carriages that took the last rays of English\\ninfluence out of the Ottoman Empire, and steep were the stairs in the\\nhouse of a stranger! Turks are not much given to laughter, but Enver\\nPasha must at least have smiled on that day.\\n\\nAlready, of course, German influence was strong in the army, which now\\nwas thoroughly trained in German methods, but that army might still be\\ncalled a Turkish army. Nowadays, by no stretch of language can it be\\ncalled Turkish except in so far that all Turkish efficient manhood is\\nhelplessly enlisted in it, for there is no branch or department of it\\nover which the Prussian octopus has not thrown its paralysing tentacles\\nand affixed its immovable suckers. Army and navy alike, the wireless\\nstations, the submarines, the aircraft, are all directly controlled from\\nBerlin, and, as we have seen, the generalissimo of the forces is\\nMackensen, who is absolutely the Hindenburg of the East. But thorough as\\nis the control of Berlin over Constantinople in military and naval\\nmatters, it is not one whit more thorough than her control in all other\\nmatters of national life. Never before has Germany been very successful\\nin her colonisation; but if complete domination--the sucking of a\\ncountry till it is a mere rind of itself, and yet at the same time full\\nto bursting of Prussian ichor--may be taken as Germany's equivalent of\\ncolonisation, then indeed we must be forced to recognise her success.\\nAnd it was all done in the name and for the sake of the Pan-Turkish\\nideal. Even now Prussian Pecksniffs like Herr Ernst Marre, whose\\npamphlet, _Die Tuerken und Wir nach dem Kriege_, was published in 1916,\\ncontinue to insist that Germany is nobly devoting herself to the\\nwell-being of Turkey. 'In doing this,' he exclaims in that illuminating\\ndocument, 'we are benefiting Turkey.... This is a war of liberation for\\nTurkey,' though omitting to say from whom Turkey is being liberated.\\nPerhaps the Armenians. Occasionally, it is true, he forgets that, and\\nnaively remarks, 'Turkey is a very difficult country to govern. But\\nafter the war Turkey will be very important as a transit country.' But\\nthen he remembers again and says, 'We wish to give besides taking, and\\nwe should often like to give more than we can hope to give.' Let us look\\ninto this, and see the manner in which Germany expresses her yearning to\\nimpoverish herself for the sake of Turkey.\\n\\nAll this reorganisation of the Turkish army was of course a very\\nexpensive affair, and required skilful financing, and it was necessary\\nto get the whole of Turkey's exchequer arrangements into German hands. A\\nseries of financial regulations was promulgated. The Finance Minister,\\nduring 1916, was still Turkish, but the official immediately under him\\nwas a German. He was authorised to deposit with the Controllers of the\\nOttoman National Debt German Imperial Bills of LT30,000,000, and to\\nissue German paper money to the like amount. This arrangement insures\\nthe circulation of the German notes, which are redeemable by Turkey in\\n_gold_ two years after the declaration of peace. Gold is declared to be\\nthe standard currency, and no creditor is obliged to accept in payment\\nof a debt more than 300 piastres in silver or fifty in nickel. And since\\nthere is no gold in currency (for it has been all called in, and\\npenalties of death have been authorised for hoarders) it follows that\\nthis and other issues of German paper will filter right through the\\nEmpire. At the same time a German expert, Dr. Kautz, was appointed to\\nstart banks throughout Turkey in order to free the peasants from the\\nTurkish village usurer, and in consequence enslave them to the German\\nbanks. Similarly a German was put at the head of the Ottoman\\nAgricultural Bank. These new branches worked very well, but it is\\npleasant to think that one such was started by the Deutsche Bank at\\nBagdad in October 1916, which now has its shutters up. Before this, as\\nwe learn from the _Oesterreichischer Volkswirt_ (June 1916), Germany had\\nissued other gold notes, in payment for gold from Turkey, which is\\nretainable in Berlin till six months after the end of the war. (It is\\nreasonable to wonder whether it will not be retained rather longer than\\nthat.) These gold notes were accepted willingly at first by the public,\\nbut the increase in their number (by the second issue) has caused them\\nto be viewed with justifiable suspicion, and the depreciation in them\\ncontinues. But the Turkish public has no redress except by hoarding\\ngold, which is a penal offence. That these arrangements have not\\nparticularly helped Turkish credit may be gathered from the fact that\\nthe Turkish gold L1, nominally 100 piastres, was very soon worth 280\\npiastres in the German paper standard, and it now fetches a great deal\\nmore.\\n\\nAgain, the Deutsche Orientbank has made many extensions, and is already\\nfinancing cotton and wool trade for after the war. The establishment of\\nthis provoked much applause in German financial circles, who find it to\\nbe an instance of the 'far-reaching and powerful Germano-Austrian unity,\\nwhich replaces the disunion of Turkish finance.' This is profoundly\\ntrue, especially if we omit the word 'Austrian' inserted for diplomatic\\nreasons. Again we find Germany advancing L3,000,000 of German paper to\\nthe Turkish Government in January 1917, for the payment of supplies they\\nhave received from Krupp's works and (vaguely) for interest to the\\nGerman Financial Minister. This, too, we may conjecture, is to be\\nredeemed after the war in gold.\\n\\nIn March of this year we find in the report of the Ottoman Bank a German\\nloan of L1,000,000 for the purchase of agricultural implements by\\nTurkey, and this is guaranteed by house-taxes. In all up to that month,\\nas was announced in the Chamber of Deputies at Constantinople, Germany\\nhad advanced to Turkey the sum of L142,000,000, entirely, it would seem,\\nin German paper, to be repaid at various dates in gold. The grip, in\\nfact, is a strangle-hold, all for Turkey's good, as no doubt will prove\\nthe 'New Conventions' announced by Zimmermann in May 1917, to take the\\nplace of the abolished Capitulations, 'which left Turkey at the mercy of\\npredatory Powers who looked for the disruption of the Ottoman Empire.'\\nHerr Zimmermann does not look for that: he looks for its absorption. And\\nsees it.\\n\\nThe industrial development of Turkey by this benevolent and\\ndisinterested Power has been equally thorough and far-reaching, though\\nGermany here has had a certain amount of competition by Hungary to\\ncontend against, for Hungary considered that Germany was trespassing on\\nher sphere of interest. But she has been able to make no appreciable\\nheadway against her more acute partner, and her application for a\\nmonopoly of sugar-production was not favourably received, for Germany\\nalready had taken the beet industry well in hand. In Asia Minor the\\nacreage of cultivation early in 1917 had fallen more than 50 per cent.\\nfrom that under crops before the war, but owing to the importation of\\nmachinery from the Central Powers, backed up by a compulsory\\nAgricultural Service Law, which has just been passed, it is hoped that\\nthe acreage will be increased this year by something like 30 per cent.\\nThe yield per acre also will be greatly increased this year, for Germany\\nhas, though needing artificial manures badly herself, sent large\\nquantities into Turkey, where they will be more profitably employed. She\\nhas no fear about securing the produce. This augmented yield will, it is\\ntrue, not be adequate to supply the needs of Turkey, who for the last\\ntwo years has suffered from very acute food shortage, which in certain\\ndistricts has amounted to famine and wholesale starvation of the poorer\\nclasses. But it is unlikely that their needs will be considered at all,\\nfor Germany's needs (she, the fairy godmother of the Pan-Turk ideal)\\nmust obviously have the first call on such provisions as are obtainable.\\nThus, in the new preserved meat factory at Aidin, the whole of the\\nproduce is sent to Germany. Thus, too, though in February 1917 there was\\na daily shortage in Smyrna of 700 sacks of flour, and the Arab and\\nGreek population was starving, no flour at all was allowed to be\\nimported into Smyrna. But simultaneously Germany was making huge\\npurchases of fish, meat, and flour in Constantinople (paid for in German\\npaper), including 100,000 sheep. Yet such was the villainous selfishness\\nof the famine-stricken folk at Adrianople that, when the trains\\ncontaining these supplies were passing through, a mob held them up and\\nsold the contents to the inhabitants. That, however, was an isolated\\ninstance, and in any case a law was passed in October 1916, appointing a\\nmilitary commission to control all supplies. It enacts that troops shall\\nbe supplied first, and specially ordains that the requirements of German\\ntroops come under this head. (Private firms have been expressly\\nprohibited from purchasing these augmented wheat supplies, but special\\npermission was given in 1915 to German and Austro-Hungarian societies to\\nbuy.) A few months later we find that there are a hundred deaths daily\\nin Constantinople from starvation, and two hundred in Smyrna, where\\nthere is a complete shortage of oil. But oil is still being sent to\\nGermany, and during 1916 five hundred reservoirs of oil were sent there,\\neach containing up to 15,000 kilogrammes. Similarly during this summer\\nthe price of fruit has gone up in Smyrna, for the Germans have reopened\\ncertain factories for preserving it and turning it into jam, which is\\nbeing sent to Germany. The sugar is supplied from the new beet-fields of\\nKonia. But Kultur must be supplied first, else Kultur would grow lean,\\nand the Turkish God of Love will look after the Smyrniotes. It is no\\nwonder that the blockade of Germany does not produce the desired result\\na little quicker, for food is already pouring in from Turkey, and when\\nthe artificial manures have produced their early harvest the stream will\\nbecome a torrent.[1]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: The harvest has now come in, and is most abundant.]\\n\\nBut during all these busy and tremendous months of war Germany has not\\nonly been denuding Turkey of her food supplies, for the sake of the\\nPan-Turkish ideal; in the same altruistic spirit she has been vastly\\nincreasing the productiveness of her new and most important colony. The\\ngreat irrigation works at Konia, begun several years ago, are in\\noperation, and the revenues of the irrigated villages have been doubled.\\nIn fact, as the report lately issued says, 'a new and fertile province\\nhas been formed by the aid of German energy and knowledge.' At Adana are\\nsimilar irrigation works, financed by the Deutsche Bank. Ernst Marre\\ngives us a most hopeful survey of them, for Adana was already linked up\\nwith the Bagdad Railway in October 1916, which was to be the great\\nartery connecting Germany with the East. There is some considerable\\nshortage of labour there (owing in part to the Armenian massacres, to\\nwhich we shall revert presently), but the financial arrangements are in\\nexcellent shape. The whole of the irrigation works are in German hands,\\nand have been paid for by German paper; and to get the reservoirs, etc.,\\nback into her own control, it has been agreed that Turkey, already\\ncompletely bankrupt, will have to pay not only what has been spent, but\\na handsome sum in compensation; while, as regards shortage of labour,\\nprisoners have been released in large numbers to work without pay. This\\nirrigation scheme at Adana will increase the cotton yield by four times\\nthe present crop, so we learn from the weekly Arab magazine, _El Alem el\\nIsmali_, which tells us also of the electric-power stations erected\\nthere.\\n\\nThe same paper (October 1916) announces to the Anatolian merchants that\\ntransport is now easy, owing to the arrival of engines and trucks from\\nGermany, while _Die Zeit_ (February 1917) prophesies a prosperous future\\nfor this Germano-Turkish cotton combine. Hitherto Turkey has largely\\nimported cotton from England; now Turkey--thanks to German capital on\\nterms above stated--will, in the process of internal development so\\nunselfishly devised for her by Germany, grow cotton for herself, and be\\nkind enough to give a preferential tariff to Germany.\\n\\nA similarly bright future may be predicted for the sugar-beet industry\\nat Konia, where are the irrigation works already referred to. Artesian\\nwells have been sunk, and there is the suggestion to introduce\\nBulgarian labour in default of Turkish. As we have seen, Hungary\\nattempted to obtain a monopoly with regard to sugar, but Germany has\\nbeen victorious on this point (as on every other where she competes with\\nHungary), and has obtained the concession for a period of thirty years.\\nShe reaped the first-fruits this last spring (1917), when, on a single\\noccasion, 350 trucks laden with sugar were despatched to Berlin. A\\nsimilar irrigation scheme is bringing into cultivation the Makischelin\\nValley, near Aleppo, and Herr Wied has been appointed as expert for\\nirrigation plant in Syria. There has been considerable shortage of coal,\\nbut now more is arriving from the Black Sea, and the new coal-fields at\\nRodosto will soon be giving an output.\\n\\nIndeed, it would be easier to enumerate the industries and economical\\ndevelopments of Turkey over which Germany has not at the present moment\\ngot the control than those over which she has. In particular she has\\nshown a parental interest in Turkish educational questions. She\\nestablished last year, under German management, a school for the study\\nof German in Constantinople; she has put under the protection of the\\nGerman Government the Jewish institution at Haifa for technical\\neducation in Palestine; from Sivas a mission of schoolmasters has been\\nsent to Germany for the study of German methods. Ernst Marre surmises\\nthat German will doubtless become compulsory even in the Turkish\\nintermediate (secondary) schools. In April 1917, the first stone of the\\n'House of Friendship' was laid at Constantinople, the object of which\\ninstitution is to create among Turkish students an interest in\\neverything German, while earlier in the year arrangements were made for\\n10,000 Turkish youths to go to Germany to be taught trades. These I\\nimagine were unfit for military service. With regard to such a scheme\\nHalil Haled Bey praises the arrangement for the education of Turks in\\nGermany. When they used to go to France, he tells us, 'they lost their\\nreligion' (certainly Prussian Got is nearer akin to Turkish Allah) 'and\\nreturned home unpatriotic and useless. In Germany they will have access\\nto suitable religious literature' (Gott!) 'and must adopt all they see\\ngood in German methods without losing their original characteristics.'\\nComment on this script is needless. The hand is the hand of Halil Haled\\nBey, but the voice is the voice of Potsdam. Occasionally, but rarely,\\nAustrian competition is seen. Professor Schmoller, in an Austrian\\nquarterly review, shows jealousy of German influence, and we find, in\\nOctober 1916, an Ottoman-Austrian college started at Vienna for 250\\npupils of the Ottoman Empire. But Germany has 10,000 in Berlin. At Adana\\n(where are the German irrigation works) the German-Turkish Society has\\nopened a German school of 300, while, reciprocally, courses in Turkish\\nhave been organised at Berlin for the sake of future German colonists.\\nIn Constantinople the _Tanin_ announces a course of lectures to be held\\nby the Turco-German Friendship Society. Professor von Marx discoursed\\nlast April on foreign influence and the development of nations, with\\nspecial reference to Turkey and the parallel case of Germany. A few\\nmonths later we find Hilmet Nazim Bey, official head of the Turkish\\npress, proceeding to Berlin to learn German press methods. A number of\\neditors of Turkish papers will follow him, and soon, no doubt, the\\nTurkish press will rival Cologne and Frankfort.\\n\\nSo much for German education, but her penetrative power extends into\\nevery branch of industry and economics. In November 1916, a Munich\\nexpert was put in charge of the College of Forestry, and an economic\\nsociety was started in Constantinople on German lines with German\\ninstructors. Inoculation against small-pox, typhoid, and cholera was\\nmade compulsory; and we find that the Turkish Ministers of Posts, of\\nJustice, and of Commerce, figureheads all of them, have Germans as their\\nacting Ministers. In the same year a German was appointed as expert for\\nsilkworm breeding and for the cultivation of beet. Practically all the\\nrailways in Asia Minor are pure German concerns by right of purchase.\\nGermany owns the Anatolian railway concession (originally British),\\nwith right to build to Angora and Konia; the Bagdad railway concession,\\nwith preferential rights over minerals; they have bought the\\nMersina-Adana Railway, with right of linking up to the Bagdad Railway;\\nthey have bought the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway, built with French capital.\\nThey have secured also the Haidar Pasha Harbour concession, thereby\\ncontrolling and handling all merchandise arriving at railhead from the\\ninterior of Asia Minor.[1] Already on the Bagdad Railway the big tunnels\\nof Taurus and Amanus are available for narrow-gauge petrol-driven\\nmotors, and the broad-gauge line will soon be complete. Meanwhile\\nrailway construction is pushed on in all directions under German\\ncontrol, and the Turkish Minister of Finance (August 1916) allocated a\\nlarge sum of German paper money for the construction of ordinary roads,\\nmilitary roads, local government roads, all of which are new to Turkey,\\nbut which will be useful for the complete German occupation which is\\nbeing swiftly consolidated. To stop the mouths of the people, all\\npolitical clubs have been suppressed by the Minister of the Interior,\\nfor Prussia does not care for criticism. To supply German ammunition\\nneeds, lead and zinc have been taken from the roofs of mosques and\\ndoor-handles from mosque-gates, and the iron railings along the Champs\\nde Mars at Pera have been carted away for the manufacture of bombs. Not\\nlong after eight truck-loads of copper were sent to Germany: these, I\\nimagine, represent the first produce of copper roofs and utensils. A\\nTurco-German convention signed in Berlin in January of this year,\\npermits subjects of one country to settle in the other while retaining\\ntheir nationality and enjoying trading and other privileges. In Lebanon\\nDr. Koenig has opened an agricultural school for Syrians of all\\nreligions. In the Homs district the threatening plague of locusts in\\nFebruary 1917 was combatted by Germans; and a German expert, Dr. Bucher,\\nhad been already sent to superintend the whole question. For this\\nconcerns supplies to Germany, as does also the ordinance passed in the\\nsame month that two-thirds of all fish caught in the Lebanon district\\nshould be given to the military authorities (these are German), and that\\nevery fish weighing over six ounces in the Beirut district should be\\nKorban also. The copper mines at Arghana Maden, near Diarbekr, are busy\\nexporting their produce into Germany; the coal-mines at Rodosto will\\nvery soon be making a large output.[2]\\n\\n[Footnote 1: The balance-sheets for 1916 of certain of those railways in\\nwhich the Deutsche Bank has an interest have come to hand. They show a\\nvery disagreeable degree of prosperity. The Anatolia Railway Company has\\nlarge profits with a gross revenue of 25,737,995 marks. The profit on\\nthe Haidar-Pasha-Angora Line has risen from 42,566 francs per kilometre\\nto 45,552. The Mersina-Tarsus-Adana Railway has paid 6 per cent. on its\\npreference shares, and 3 per cent. on its ordinary shares. The Haidar\\nPasha Harbour Company has paid 8 per cent.]\\n\\n[Footnote 2: Later in this year we find three trains daily leaving\\nConstantinople for Germany, laden with coal and military supplies.]\\n\\nThere is no end to this penetration: German water-seekers, with divining\\nand boring apparatus, accompanied the Turkish expedition into Sinai;\\nRussian prisoners were sent by Germany for agricultural work in Asia\\nMinor, to take the place of slaughtered Armenians; a German-Turkish\\ntreaty, signed January 11, 1917, gives the whole reorganisations of the\\neconomic system to a special German mission. A Stuttgart journal chants\\na characteristic _Lobgesang_ over this feat. 'That is how,' it proudly\\nexclaims, 'we work for the liberation of peoples and nationalities.'\\n\\nIn the same noble spirit, we must suppose, German legal reforms were\\nintroduced in December 1916, to replace the Turkish Shuriat, and in the\\nsame month all the Turks in telegraph offices in Constantinople were\\nreplaced by Germans. Ernst Marre gives valuable advice to young Germans\\nsettling in Turkey. He particularly recommends them, knowing how\\nreligion is one of the strongest bonds in this murderous race, to 'trade\\nin articles of devotion, in rosaries, in bags to hold the Koran,' and\\npoints out what good business might be built up in gramophones. Earlier\\nin this year we find a 'German Oriental Trading Company' founded for the\\nimport of fibrous materials for needs of military authorities, and a\\ngreat carpet business established at Urfa with German machinery that\\nwill supplant the looms of Smyrna. A saltpetre factory is established\\nat Konia by Herr Toepfer, whose enterprise is rewarded with an Iron\\nCross and a Turkish decoration. The afforestation near Constantinople,\\nordered by the Ministry of Agriculture, is put into German hands, and in\\nthe vilayet of Aidin (April 1916) ninety concessions were granted to\\nGerman capitalists to undertake the exploitation of metallic ores.\\nOccasionally the German octopus finds it has gone too far for the\\nmoment, and releases some struggling limb of its victim, as, for\\ninstance, when we see that, in September 1916, the German Director's\\nstamp for the 'Imperial German Great Radio Station' at Damascus has been\\ndiscarded temporarily, as that station 'should be treated for the\\npresent as a Turkish concern.'\\n\\nA 'Trading and Weaving Company' was established at Angora in 1916, an\\n'Import and Export Company' at Smyrna, a 'Trading and Industrial\\nSociety' at Beirut, a 'Tobacco Trading Company' at Latakieh, an\\n'Agricultural Company' at Tripoli, a 'Corn Exporting Company' in\\nLebanon, a 'Rebuilding Commission' (perhaps for sacked Armenian houses)\\nat Konia. More curious yet will be a Tourist's Guide Book--a Baedeker,\\nin fact--for travellers in Anatolia, and the erection of a monument in\\nhonour of Turkish _women_ who have replaced men called up for military\\nduty. Truly these last two items--a guide-book for Anatolia, and a\\nmonument to women--are strange enterprises for Turks. A new Prussian day\\nis dawning, it seems, for Turkish women as well, for the _Tanin_ (April\\n1917) tells us that diplomas are to be conferred on ladies who have\\ncompleted their studies in the Technical School at Constantinople.\\n\\nIt is needless to multiply instances of German penetration: I have but\\ngiven the skeleton of this German monster that has fastened itself with\\ntentacles and suckers on every branch of Turkish industry. There is none\\nround which it has not cast its feelers--no Semitic moneylender ever\\nobtained a surer hold on his victim. In matters naval, military,\\neducational, legal, industrial, financial, Germany has a strangle-hold.\\nTurkey's life is already crushed out of her, and, as we have seen, it\\nhas been crushed out of her by the benevolent Kultur-mongers, who, among\\nall the Great Powers of Europe, invested their time and their money in\\nthe achievement of the Pan-Turkish ideal. Silently and skilfully they\\nworked, bamboozling their chief tool, Enver Pasha, even as Enver Pasha\\nbamboozled us. As long as he was of service to them they retained him;\\nfor his peace of mind at one time they stopped up all letter-boxes in\\nConstantinople because so many threatening letters were sent him. But\\nnow Enver Pasha seems to have had his day; he became a little\\nautocratic, and thought that he was the head of the Pan-Turkish ideal.\\nSo he was, but the Pan-Turkish ideal had become Pan-Prussian, and he had\\nnot noticed the transformation. Talaat Bey has taken his place; it was\\nhe who, in May 1917, was received by the Emperor William, by King\\nLudwig, and by the Austrian Emperor, and he who was the mouthpiece of\\nthe German efforts to make a separate peace with Russia. Under Czardom,\\nhe proclaimed, the existence of Turkey was threatened, but now the\\nrevolution has made friendship possible, for Russia no longer desires\\nterritorial annexation. And, oh, how Turkey would like to be Russia's\\nfriend! Enver Pasha has of late been somewhat out of favour in Berlin,\\nand I cannot but think it curious that when, on April 2, 1917, he\\nvisited the submarine base at Wilhelmshaven, he was very nearly killed\\nin a motor accident. But it may have been an accident. Since then I\\ncannot find that he has taken any more active part in Pan-Turkish ideals\\nthan to open a soup-kitchen in some provincial town, and lecture the\\nCentral Committee of the Young Turks on the subject of internal affairs\\nin Great Britain. I do not like lectures, but I should have liked to\\nhear that one.\\n\\n\\nI have left to the end of this chapter the question of Germany's\\nknowledge of, and complicity in the Armenian massacres. From the tribune\\nof the Reichstag, on January 15, 1916, there was made a definite denial\\nof the existence of such massacres at all; on another subsequent\\noccasion it was stated that Germany could not interfere in Turkish\\ninternal affairs.\\n\\nIn view of the fact that there is no internal affair appertaining to\\nTurkey in which Germany has not interfered, the second of these\\nstatements may be called insincere. But the denial of the massacres is a\\ndeliberate lie. Germany--official Germany--knew all about them, and she\\npermitted them to go on. A few proofs of this are here shortly stated.\\n\\n(1) In September 1915, four months before the denial of the massacres\\nwas made in the Reichstag, Dr. Martin Niepage, higher grade teacher in\\nthe German Technical School at Aleppo, prepared and sent, as we have\\nseen, in his name, and that of several of his colleagues, a report of\\nthe massacres to the German Embassy at Constantinople. In that report he\\ngives a terrible account of what he has seen with his own eyes, and also\\nstates that the country Turks' explanation with regard to the origin of\\nthese measures is that it was 'the teaching of the Germans.' The German\\nEmbassy at Constantinople therefore knew of the massacres, and knew\\nalso that the Turks attributed them to orders from Germany. Dr. Niepage\\nalso consulted, before sending his report, with the German Consul at\\nAleppo, Herr Hoffman, who told him that the German Embassy had been\\nalready advised in detail about the massacres from the consulates at\\nAlexandretta, Aleppo, and Mosul, but that he welcomed a further protest\\non the subject.\\n\\n(2) These reports, or others like them, had not gone astray, for in\\nAugust 1915, the German Ambassador in Constantinople, Baron Wangenheim,\\nmade a formal protest to the Turkish Government about the massacres.\\n\\nThere is, then, no doubt that the German Government, when it officially\\ndenied the massacres, was perfectly cognisant of them. It was also\\nperfectly capable of stopping them, for they were not local violences,\\nbut wholesale murders organised at Constantinople. In support of this\\nview I find an independent witness stating that 'there is no Turk of\\nstanding who will not readily declare that it would have been perfectly\\npossible for Germany to have vetoed the massacres had she chosen.'\\nGermany had indeed already given assurances that such massacres should\\nnot occur. She had assured the Armenian Katholikos at Adana that so long\\nas Germany has any influence in Turkey he need not fear a repetition of\\nthe horrors that had taken place under Abdul Hamid. Had she, then, no\\ninfluence in Constantinople, or how was it that she had obtained\\ncomplete control over all Turkish branches of government? The same\\nassurance was given by the German Ambassador in April 1915, to the\\nArmenian Patriarch and the President of the Armenian National Council.\\n\\nSo, in support of the Pan-Turkish ideal, and in the name of the Turkish\\nAllah, the God of Love, Germany stood by and let the infamous tale of\\nlust and rapine and murder be told to its end. The Turks had planned to\\nexterminate the whole Armenian race except some half-million, who would\\nbe deported penniless to work on agricultural developments under German\\nrule, but this quality of Turkish mercy was too strained for Major\\nPohl, who proclaimed that it was a mistake to spare so many. But he was\\na soldier, and did not duly weigh the claims of agriculture.\\n\\nThe choice was open to Germany; Germany chose, and let the Armenian\\nmassacres go on. But she was in a difficulty. What if the Turkish\\nGovernment retorted (perhaps it did so retort), 'You are not consistent.\\nWhy do you mind about the slaughter of a few Armenians? What about\\nBelgium and your atrocities there?'\\n\\nAnd all the ingenuity of the Wilhelmstrasse would not be able to find an\\nanswer to that.\\n\\nI do not say that Germany wanted the massacres, for she did not. She\\nwanted more agricultural labour, and I think that, if only for that\\nreason, she deprecated them. But she allowed them to go on when it was\\nin her power to stop them, and all the perfumes of Arabia will not wash\\nclean her hand from that stinking horror.\\n\\nHere, then, are some of the problems which those who, at the end of the\\nwar, will have to deal with the problem of Turkey must tackle. It is\\njust as well to recognise that at the present moment Turkey is virtually\\nand actually a German colony, and the most valuable colony that Germany\\nhas ever had. It will not be enough to limit, or rather abolish, the\\nsupremacy of Turkey over aliens and martyrised peoples; it will be\\nnecessary first to abolish the supremacy of Germany over Turkey. To do\\nthis the victory of our Allied Nations must be complete, and Germany's\\noctopus envelopment of Turkish industries severed. Otherwise we shall\\nimmediately be confronted with a Germany that already reaches as far as\\nMesopotamia. That is done now; and that, before there can come any\\npermanent peace for Europe, must be undone. Nothing less than the\\ncomplete release of that sucker and tentacle embrace will suffice.\\n\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nAs throwing a sidelight on the German complicity in the Armenian\\nmassacres, the following is of interest. It is known that when\\nMetternich succeeded Wangenheim as German Ambassador in Constantinople,\\nhe brought with him a speech, written in Berlin, which, by the Kaiser's\\norders, he was to read when presenting his credentials to the Sultan.\\nThis contained a sentence which implied that Germany had been unable to\\nstop the Armenian massacres. Talaat refused to allow the speech to be\\nread, obviously because it threw the responsibility of the massacres on\\nto the Turks, whereas the accepted opinion in Turkey was that they took\\nplace with the connivance and even at the instigation of the Germans.\\nEventually a compromise was arrived at, and the speech _in toto_ was\\nread privately, the part referring to the Armenian massacre not being\\npublished.... It is a pity that Germany is always found out....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Chapter VI_\\n\\n\\n'THY KINGDOM IS DIVIDED'\\n\\nLet us commit the crime of _lese-majeste_, and assume (though the\\nEmperor Wilhelm II. has repeatedly announced the contrary) that Germany\\nis not at the conclusion of the European War to find herself in\\npossession of the world. She has prepared her plans in anticipation of\\nthe auspicious event; in fact she has had a most interesting map of\\nEurope produced which, except by its general shape, is scarcely\\nrecognisable. The printing of it, it is true, was a little premature,\\nfor it shows what Europe was to have been like in 1916, and the\\napportionments are not borne out by facts. But assuming that there is\\nsome radical error about it all from her point of view, and assuming\\nthat there will not be either a conclusive peace favourable to Prussian\\ninterests, or even an inconclusive peace, but one in which the Allies\\nwill be able to dictate and enforce their own terms, the magnitude of\\nthe problems that will await their decision may well appal the most\\ningenious of their statesmen. And of all those problems none, it is safe\\nto prophesy, will be found more difficult of solution than that which\\nwill deal with the future of the corrupt and barbarous Government which\\nhas for centuries made hell of the Ottoman Empire. We know more or less\\nwhat will happen to Alsace and Lorraine, to Belgium, to the Trentino,\\nbecause in those cases the claims of one or other of our Allies to\\ndemand a particular settlement are quite certain to be agreed to by\\nthose not so immediately and vitally concerned. But in the Balkans these\\nproblems will be more complicated because of conflicting interests, and\\nmost complicated of all will they be in Turkey. One thing, however, is\\ncertain, that there can be no going back to the conditions that existed\\nthere before the war.\\n\\nEver since the Osmanlis came out of remoter Asia into the Nearer East\\nand into Europe, the government of their Empire has gone from bad to\\nworse. In the early days, as we have seen, their policy was to absorb\\nthe strength of their subject peoples by incorporating the youth of them\\ninto the Turkish army, by giving them Turkish wives, and by converting\\nthem to Mohammedanism. Such was the foundation of the Empire and such\\nits growth. But having absorbed their strength, the Sultan's Government\\nneglected them until they milked them again. They were allowed to\\nprosper if they could: all that was demanded of them was a toll of their\\nstrength. They were cattle, and for the right to graze on Turkish lands\\nthey paid back a pail of their milk of manhood. But an empire founded on\\nsuch principles contains within it active and prolific seeds of decay,\\nand, as we have seen, more stringent measures had to be resorted to in\\norder to preserve the supremacy of the ruling people. Instead of\\nabsorbing their strength, Abdul Hamid hit upon the new method of killing\\nthem, so that the Turks should still maintain their domination. And the\\npolicy set on foot by him was developed but a few years ago into a\\nscheme of slaughter, which in atrocity has far surpassed the killings of\\nAttila, of whom the Nationalist poet sings, or even the designs of the\\ndeposed Sultan. The Armenian nation, with the exception of such part of\\nit as has escaped into Russian territory, has been exterminated, and\\nsimilar measures have been planned and indeed begun, against the Greeks,\\nthe Arabs, and the Jews.\\n\\nIn consequence of this, in consequence also of the European War, the\\npolicy of the Balance of Power as regards Turkey has been at length\\nabandoned. The Allies have definitely declared in their joint note to\\nPresident Wilson their aims in the war, and for those they have pledged\\nthemselves to fight until final and complete victory wreathes their\\narms. Among these aims are:--\\n\\n(1) The liberation of the peoples who now lie beneath the murderous\\ntyranny of the Turks.\\n\\n(2) The expulsion from Europe of the Ottoman Empire, which has proved\\nitself so radically alien to Western civilisation.\\n\\nFor a century that most inharmonious of orchestras called the Concert\\nof Europe has, owing to the exigencies of the Balance of Power, kept\\nTurkey together, and in particular has maintained the centre of its\\ngovernment at Constantinople simply because the Balance of Power would\\nbe upset if anybody else held the key of the straits that separate\\nRussia from the Mediterranean. England, above all others, was\\ninstrumental in preserving that precarious Balance, and England now must\\nconfess the utter failure of her policy there throughout a century. It\\nis humiliating to acknowledge the complete collapse of that which for so\\nmany decades has been the keystone of our ruling with regard to our\\nEastern Empire, but the arch has collapsed; Germany pulled the keystone\\nout, and all our efforts to exclude Russia from free access to the\\nMediterranean have only resulted in letting Germany in. To-day she holds\\nConstantinople, and the bitter pill must be swallowed. The situation, as\\nit stands at this moment, is infinitely worse than it could have been\\nfor a century back, if at any moment during those hundred years we had\\ndone what we always ought to have done, and declared that the\\nanachronism of Turkey being in Europe was more intolerable than anything\\nthat could happen in consequence of her expulsion. But we have\\nacknowledged that now. We have also acknowledged the even greater\\nanachronism of Turkey being allowed to dispose of the destinies of any\\nof those peoples who inhabit the territories of the Ottoman Empire, for\\nthe Allies, in their joint Note, have declared that the remedy of these\\ntwo monstrous abuses forms an essential part of their aim in the war,\\nwhich in costliness of life and of treasure has already far exceeded any\\ncataclysm that could have come to Europe through its doing its clear and\\nChristian duty with regard to Turkey during the preceding hundred years.\\nAnd among the benefits which eventually mankind will reap in the fields\\nthat have been sown by the blood of the slain will be the fact that the\\nConfusion of Europe will have accomplished a task which the Concert of\\nEurope was too craven of consequences to undertake; and Constantinople\\nand the subject peoples of the Turks will have passed from the yoke of\\nthat murderous tyranny for ever.\\n\\nWe will take these two avowed aims of the Allies in order, and first try\\nto draw (though with diffident pencil) some sketch of what will be the\\nconfines of the Ottoman Empire, when we pluck the fruits of the great\\ncrusade against the barbarism of Turkey and of Germany. It is quite\\nuseless to attempt to keep the map as it was, and peg out claims within\\nthe Empire where we shall proclaim that Arabs and Greeks and Armenians\\nshall live in peace, for it is exactly that plan which has formed a\\ncentury's failure. At the International Congress of Berlin, for\\ninstance, a solemn pact was entered into by Turkey for the reform of the\\nArmenian vilayets. She carried out her promise by slaughtering every\\nArmenian male, and outraging every Armenian woman who inhabited them.\\nThe _soi-disant_ protectorate of Crete was not a whit more successful in\\nsecuring for the Cretans a tolerable existence, and the Allies had to\\nbring it to an end twenty years ago, and free them from the execrable\\nyoke; while finally the repudiation by Turkey of the Capitulations,\\nwhich provided some sort of guarantee for the safety of foreign peoples\\nin Turkey, has shown us, if further proof was needed, the value of\\ncovenants with the Osmanli. It must be rendered impossible for Turkey to\\nrepeat such outrages: the soil where her alien peoples dwell must be\\nhers no more, and any Turkish aggression on that soil must be, _ipso\\nfacto_, an act of war against the European Power under the protection of\\nwhom such a province is placed.\\n\\nThe difficulty of this part of the problem is not so great as might at\\nfirst appear. We do not, when we come to look at it in detail, find such\\na conflict of interests as would seem to face us on a general view. Even\\nthe precarious Balance of Power was not upset by a quantity of similar\\nadjustments made by the Concert of Europe during the last hundred years.\\nThe Powers freed Serbia, giving Turkey first a suzerainty over her, and\\nfinally abolishing that: they freed Bulgaria, they freed Greece, Eastern\\nRumelia, Macedonia, Albania. But, as by some strange lapse of humanity,\\nthey always regarded the subject peoples of Turkey in Asia as more\\npeculiarly Turkish, as if at the Bosporus a new moral geography began,\\nand massacre in Asia was comparatively venial as compared with massacre\\nin Europe. But now the Allies have said that there must be no more\\nmassacres in Asia, nor any possibility of them. To secure this, it will\\nbe necessary to sever from Turkey the lands where the alien peoples\\ndwell, and form autonymous provinces under the protectorate of one or\\nother of the allied nations. In most cases we shall find that there is a\\nprotecting Power more or less clearly indicated, whose sphere of\\ninterest is obviously concerned with one or other of these new and\\nindependent provinces.\\n\\nThe alien race which for the last thirty years has suffered the most\\natrociously from Turkish inhumanity is that of the Armenians, and it is\\nfitting to begin our belated campaign of liberation with it. If the\\nreader will turn to the map at the end of this book, he will see that\\nthe district marked Armenia lies at the north-west corner of the old\\nOttoman Empire, and extends across its frontiers into Russian\\nTrans-Caucasia. That indicates the district which once was peopled by\\nArmenians. To-day, owing to the various Armenian massacres, the latest\\nof which, described in another chapter, was by far the most appalling,\\nsuch part of Armenia as lies in the Ottoman Empire is practically, and\\nprobably absolutely, depopulated of its Armenian inhabitants. Such as\\nsurvive, apart from the women whose lives were spared on their\\nprofessing Islamism and entering Turkish harems, have escaped beyond the\\nRussian frontier, and are believed to number about a quarter of a\\nmillion. In the meantime their homes have partly been destroyed and\\npartly occupied by mouhadjirs from Thrace, and by the Kurds who were\\nlargely instrumental in butchering them. Their lands have been\\nappropriated haphazardly, by, any who laid hands on them.\\n\\nHere the problem is of no great difficulty. The robber-tenants must be\\nevicted, and the remnant of the Armenians repatriated. Without\\nexception they escaped into Trans-Caucasia from villages and districts\\nnear the frontier, else they could never have escaped from the pursuing\\nTurks and Kurds. Naturally, this remnant of a people will not nearly\\nsuffice to fill their entire province, but in order to satisfy the\\nclaims of justice at all adequately, the whole district of Armenia, as\\nArmenia was known before its people were exterminated, must be amputated\\nby a clean cut out of the Ottoman Empire and placed, in an autonomous\\ncondition in a new protected province, which will include all the\\nvilayets of Armenia.\\n\\nThere is no doubt about a prosperous future for Armenia if this is done,\\nand to do less than this would be to fail signally as regards the solemn\\npromise made by the Allies when they stated to President Wilson their\\naims in the war. The Armenians have ever been a thrifty and industrious\\npeople, possessed of an inherent vitality which has withstood centuries\\nof fiendish oppression. With facilities given them for their\\nre-settlement, and with foreign protection to establish them, they will,\\nbeyond question, more than hold their own against the Kurds. As a\\nnation they are, as we have seen, partly agricultural in their pursuits;\\nbut a considerable proportion of them (and these the more intelligent)\\nare men of business, merchants, doctors, educationalists, and gravitate\\nto towns. Constantinople, as we shall see, will be open to them again,\\nwhere lately they numbered nearly as many as the entire remnant of their\\nnation numbers now; so, too, will be the cities of Syria, of Palestine,\\nand of Mesopotamia in the New Turkey which we are attempting to sketch.\\nThey will probably not care to settle in the towns and districts that\\nwill remain in the hands of their late oppressors and murderers.\\n\\nIn the work of their repatriation none will be more eager to help than\\nthe American missionaries, who, at the time of the last massacre, as so\\noften before, showed themselves so nobly disregardant of all personal\\ndanger and risk in doing their utmost for their murdered flock, and who\\nhave explicitly declared their intention of resuming their work. With\\nregard to the eviction of Kurds that will be necessary, it must be\\nremembered that the Kurd is a trespasser on the plains and towns of\\nArmenia, and properly belongs to the mountains from which he was\\nencouraged to descend by the Turks for purposes of massacre. Out of\\nthose towns and plains he must go, either into the mountains of Armenia\\nfrom whence he came, or over the frontier of Armenia into the New Turkey\\npresently to be defined. He must, in fact, be deported, though not in\\nthe manner of the deportations at which he himself so often assisted.\\n\\nThe Armenians who will thus be reinstated within the boundaries of their\\nown territory, will be practically penniless and without any of the\\nmeans or paraphernalia of life, and the necessary outlay on supplies for\\nthem, and the cost of their rehabilitation would naturally fall on the\\nprotecting Power. They will, however, be free from the taxes they have\\nhitherto paid to the Turks, and it should not be difficult for them by\\nmeans of taxes far less oppressive, to pay an adequate interest on the\\nmoneys expended on them. These would thus take the form of a very small\\nloan, the whole of which could easily be repaid by the Armenians in the\\ncourse of a generation or so. Once back on their own soil, and free from\\nTurkish tyranny and the possibility of it, they are bound to prosper,\\neven as they have prospered hitherto in spite of oppressions and\\nmassacres up till the year 1915, when, as we have seen, the liberal and\\nprogressive Nationalists organised and executed the extermination from\\nwhich so few escaped.\\n\\nIt is hardly necessary to point out who the protecting Power would be in\\nthe case of the repatriated Armenians, for none but Russia is either\\ndesirable or possible. With one side along the Russian frontier of\\nTrans-Caucasia, the New Armenia necessarily falls into the sphere of\\nRussian influence.\\n\\nIt has been suggested that not only Armenia proper, but part of Cilicia\\nshould also become a district of the repatriated Armenians, with an\\noutlet to the sea. But while it is true that complete compensation would\\ndemand this, since Zeitun and other districts in Cilicia were almost\\npure Armenian settlements, I cannot think that such a restoration is\\ndesirable. For, in the first place, the extermination of the Zeitunlis\\n(as carried out by Jemal the Great) was practically complete. All the\\nmen were slaughtered, and it does not seem likely that any of the women\\nand girls who were deported reached the 'agricultural colony' of\\nDeir-el-Zor in the Arabian desert. It is therefore difficult to see of\\nwhom the repatriation would consist. In the second place, the New\\nArmenia will be for several generations to come of an area more than\\nample for all the Armenians who have survived the flight into Russia,\\nand it obviously will give them the best chance of corporate prosperity,\\nif the whole of them are repatriated in a compact body rather than that\\na portion of them should be formed into a mere patch severed from their\\ncountrymen by so large a distance. Another sphere of influence also will\\nbe operating near the borders of Cilicia, and to place the Armenians\\nunder two protecting Powers would have serious disadvantages. In\\naddition they never were a sea-going people, and I cannot see what\\nobject would be served by giving them a coast-board. In any case, if a\\ncoast-board was found necessary, the most convenient would be the\\ncoast-board of the Black Sea, lying adjacent to their main territory.\\n\\nIf it seems clear that for New Armenia the proper protecting Power is\\nRussia, it is no less clear that for the freed inhabitants of New Syria,\\nArabs and Greeks alike, the proper protecting Power is France.\\nHistorically France's connection with Syria dates from the time of the\\nCrusades in 1099; it has never been severed, and of late years the ties\\nbetween the two countries have been both strengthened and multiplied.\\nThe Treaties of Paris, of London, of San Stefano, and of Berlin have all\\nrecognised the affiliation; so, too, from an ecclesiastical standpoint,\\nhave the encyclicals of Leo XIII. in 1888 and 1898. Similarly, it was\\nFrance who intervened in the Syrian massacres of 1845, who landed troops\\nfor the protection of the Maronites in 1860, and established a\\nprotectorate of the Lebanon there a few years later, which lasted up\\ntill the outbreak of the European War. France was the largest holder, as\\nshe was also the constructor, of Syrian railways, and the harbour of\\nBeirut, without doubt destined to be one of the most flourishing ports\\nof the Eastern Mediterranean, was also a French enterprise. And perhaps\\nmore important than all these, as a link between Syria and France, has\\nbeen the educational penetration which France has effected there. What\\nthe American missionaries did for Armenia, France has done for Syria,\\nand according to a recent estimate, of the 65,000 children who attended\\nEuropean schools throughout Syria, not less than 40,000 attended French\\nschools. When we consider that that proportion has been maintained for\\nmany years in Syria, it can be estimated how strong the intellectual\\nbond between the Syrian and the French now is. The French language,\\nsimilarly, is talked everywhere: it is as current as is modern Greek in\\nports of the Levant.\\n\\nIn virtue of such claims few, if any, would dispute the title of France\\nto be the protecting Power in the case of Syria. Here there will not\\nbe, as was the case with the Armenians, any work of repatriation to be\\ndone. Such devastation and depopulation as has been wrought by Jemal the\\nGreat, with hunger and disease to help him, was wrought on the spot,\\nand, though it will take many years to heal the wounds inflicted by that\\nbarbaric plagiarist of Potsdam, it is exactly the deft and practical\\nsympathy of the French with the race they have so long tended, which\\nwill most speedily bring back health to the Syrians.\\n\\nIt will be with regard to the geographical limits of a French\\nprotectorate that most difficulty is likely to be experienced; there\\nwill also be points claiming careful solution, as will be seen later,\\nwith regard to railway control. Northwards and eastwards the natural\\ndelimitations seem clear enough: northwards French Syria would terminate\\nwith, and include, the province of Aleppo, eastwards the Syrian desert\\nmarks its practical limits, the technical limit being supplied by the\\ncourse of the Euphrates. But southwards there is no such natural line of\\ndemarcation; the Arab occupation stretches right down till it reaches\\nthe Hedjaz, which already has thrown off the Turkish yoke and, under the\\nShereef of Mecca, declared its independence. Inset into this long strip\\nof territory lies Palestine.\\n\\nNow to make one single French protectorate over this very considerable\\nterritory seems at first sight a large order, but the objections to any\\nother course are many and insuperable. Should the line of French\\ninfluence be drawn farther north than the Hedjaz, under what protection\\nis the intervening territory to be left? At present it is Turkish, but\\ninhabited by Arabs, and, unless the Allies revoke the fulness of their\\ndeclaration not to leave alien peoples under the 'murderous tyranny' of\\nthe Turks, Turkish it cannot remain. But both by geographical situation\\nand by racial interest, it belongs to French-protected Syria, and there\\nseems no answer to the question as to what sphere of influence it comes\\nunder if not under the French. Just as properly, if we take this view of\\nthe question, the Sinaitic Peninsula, largely desert, would fall to\\nEgypt, the French protectorate being defined westwards at Akabah. That\\nthe Eastern side of the Gulf of Suez should not be under the same\\ncontrol as the Western has always been an anomaly, admitted even by the\\nsternest opponents of the status of Egypt; and in the absence of any\\ncanal corresponding to that of Suez, and debouching into the Red Sea\\n_via_ the Gulf of Akabah, the most advanced champion of French influence\\nin the Near East would see no objection to this rectified frontier.\\nThere is no question of competition involved. The proposed change is but\\na rational rectification of the present status.\\n\\nThis scheme of delimitation leaves Palestine inset into the French\\nprotectorate of Syria, and it is difficult to see to whom the\\nprotectorate of Palestine should be properly assigned except to France.\\nItaly has no expansive ambitions in that sector of the Mediterranean;\\nEngland's national sphere of influence in this partition of the\\ndistricts now occupied by alien peoples in the Ottoman Empire lies\\nobviously elsewhere; and since the Jews, who settled in ever-increasing\\nnumbers in Palestine before the war, and will assuredly continue to\\nsettle there again, come and will come as refugees from the Russian\\nPale, it would be clearly inadvisable to assign to Russia the\\nprotectorate of her own refugees. The only other alternative would be to\\ncreate an independent Palestine for the Jews, and the reasons against\\nthat are overwhelming. It would be merely playing into the hands of\\nGermany to make such an arrangement. For the last thirty years Germany\\nhas watched with personal and special interest this immigration of Jews\\ninto Palestine, seeing in it not so much a Jewish but a German\\nexpansion. Indeed, when, in the spring of this year, as we have noticed,\\na massacre and deportation of Jews was planned and begun by Jemal,\\nGermany so far reversed her usual attitude towards massacres in general,\\nand her expressed determination never to interfere in Turkey's internal\\naffairs, as to lodge a peremptory protest, and of course got the\\npersecution instantly stopped. Her reason was that Pan-Turkish 'ideals'\\n(the equivalent for the massacre of alien people) had no sort of\\nmeaning in Palestine. But the Pan-Germanic ideals had a great deal of\\nmeaning in Palestine, as Dr. Davis Treitsch _(Die Jueden der Tuerkei)_\\nvery clearly states. For 'as a result of the war,' he tells us, 'there\\nwill be an emigration of East-European Jews on an unprecedented scale\\n ... the disposal of the East European Jews will be a problem for Germany\\n(and) Germans will be only too glad to find a way out in the emigration\\nof those Jews to Turkey, a solution extraordinarily favourable to the\\ninterests of all _three [sic]_ parties concerned. There are grounds for\\ntalking of a German protectorate over the whole of Jewry.'\\n\\nNow this is explicit enough; Germany clearly contemplated a protectorate\\nover Palestine, and if the Jews who are German-speaking Jews are left\\nindependent, there is nothing more certain than that, after the war, her\\npenetration of Palestine will instantly begin. These colonists are, and\\nwill be, in want of funds for the development and increase of their\\ncultivated territories, and when we consider the names of the prominent\\nfinanciers in the Central Empires, Mendelssohn, Hirsch, Goldsmid,\\nBleichroeder, Speyer, to name only a few, we cannot be in much doubt as\\nto the quarter from which that financial assistance will be forthcoming,\\non extremely favourable terms. It is safe to prophesy that, if Palestine\\nis given independence without protectorate, in three years from the end\\nof the war it will be under not only a protectorate, but a despotism as\\ncomplete as ever ruled either Turkey or Prussia. True it is that the\\nZionist movement will offer, even as it has offered in the past, a\\nstrenuous opposition to Germanisation, but it would be crediting it with\\nan inconceivable vitality to imagine that it will be able to resist the\\nblandishments that Germany is certainly prepared to shower on it. For\\ngreat as is the progress the Jewish settlers made in Palestine during\\nthe twenty or twenty-five years before the war, and strong as is the\\nspirit of Zionism, the emigrants do not as yet number more than about\\n120,000, nor have they under crops more than ten per cent. of the\\ncultivated land of Palestine. They are as yet but settlers, and their\\nwork is before them. If left without a protectorate they will not be\\nwithout a protectorate long, but not such an one as the Allies desire. A\\nprotectorate there must be, and no reason is really of weight against\\nthat protectorate being French. Let that, then, extend from the\\nMediterranean to the Euphrates, and from Alexandretta to where the\\nHedjaz already prospers in its self-proclaimed independence. It will be\\ncompletely severed from Turkey by tracts under protection of one or\\nother of the Allied Powers, any expedition through which would be an act\\nof war.\\n\\nThe Euphrates, then, will form the eastern boundary of the French\\nprotectorate: it will also, it is hoped, form the western boundary of\\nthe English protectorate, which we know as Mesopotamia. Just as no other\\nPower has any real claim to Armenia, except Russia, just as Syria can\\nfall to no other than France, it seems equally clear that the proper\\nsphere of English influence is in this plain that stretches southwards\\nfrom the semicircle of hills where the two great rivers approach each\\nother near Diarbekr to the head of the Persian Gulf. As Germany very\\nwell knows, it is intimately concerned with our safe tenure of India,\\nand the hold the Germans hoped to gain over it, and have for ever lost,\\nby their possession of the Bagdad Railway was vital to their dreams of\\nworld-conquest. Equally vital to England was it that Germany should\\nnever get it. But its importance to us as a land-route to India is by no\\nmeans the only reason why an English sphere of influence is indicated\\nhere: it is the possibilities it harbours, which, as far as can be seen,\\nEngland is the only Power capable of developing, that cause us to put in\\na claim for its protectorate which none of our Allies will dispute.\\n\\nTo restore Mesopotamia to the rank it has held, and to the rank it still\\nmight hold among the productive districts of the East, there is needed a\\nhuge capital for outlay, and a huge population of workers. Even Germany,\\nin her nightmare of world-dominion, from which she shall be soon dragged\\nscreaming-awake, never formulated a scheme for the restoration of\\nSouthern Mesopotamia to its productive pre-eminence, and never so much\\nas contemplated it, except as an object that would be possible of\\nrealisation after the Empire of India had fallen over-ripe into her\\npelican mouth. Therein she was perfectly right--she usually is right in\\nthese dreams of empire in so far as they are empirical--for she seems\\ndimly to have conjectured in these methodical visions, that India was\\nthe key to unlock Southern Mesopotamia. But nowhere can I find that she\\nguessed it: I only guess that she guessed it.\\n\\nThis problem of capital outlay and of the necessary man-power for work\\nand restoration applies exclusively to Southern Mesopotamia, which we\\nmay roughly define as the district stretching from Samara on the Tigris\\nand Hit on the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf. Northern Mesopotamia, as\\nDr. Rohrbach points out in his _Bagdadbahn_, needs only the guarantee of\\nsecurity of life and property to induce the Kurds to descend from the\\nhills and the Bedouin Arabs to settle down there; and by degrees, under\\na protectorate that insures them against massacre and confiscation of\\nproperty, there seems no doubt that the area of cultivation will spread\\nand something of the ancient prosperity return. The land is immensely\\nfertile: it is only Ottoman misrule, which here, as everywhere else, has\\nleft desolation in the place of prosperity and death in place of life.\\nThe rainfall is adequate, the climate suitable to those who will\\nnaturally spread there: it needs only freedom from the murderous tyranny\\nthat has bled it for centuries past, to guarantee its future prosperity.\\n\\nBut Southern Mesopotamia is a totally different proposition. The land\\nlies low between the rivers, and, though of unparalleled fertility,\\nyields under present conditions but a precarious livelihood to its\\nsparse population. For nine months of the year it is a desert, for three\\nmonths when its rivers are in flood, a swamp. Once, as we all know, it\\nwas the very heart of civilisation, and from its arteries flowed out the\\nlife-blood of the world. Rainfall was scarcely existent, any more than\\nit is existent in Southern or Upper Egypt; but in the days of Babylon\\nthe Great there were true rulers and men of wisdom over these\\ndesiccated regions, who saw that every drop of water in the river, that\\nnow pours senselessly through swamp and desert into the sea, was a grain\\nof corn or a stalk of cotton. They dug canals, they made reservoirs, and\\nharnessed like some noble horse of the gods the torrents that now gallop\\nunbridled through dreary deserts. The black land, the Sawad, was then\\nthe green land of waving corn, where three crops were annually harvested\\nand the average yield was two hundredfold of the seed sown. The wheat\\nand barley, so Herodotus tells us, were a palm-breadth long in the\\nblade, and millet and sesame grew like trees. And in these details the\\nrevered Father of Lies seems to have spoken less than the truth, for the\\nstatistics we get elsewhere more than bear out his accounts of its\\namazing fertility. From its wealth before his day had arisen the might\\nof Babylon, and for centuries later, while the canals still regulated\\nthe water supply, it remained the granary of the world. More than a\\nthousand years after Herodotus there were over 12,500,000 acres in\\ncultivation, and the husbandmen thereof with the dwellers in its cities\\nnumbered 5,000,000 men. Then came the Arab invasion, which was bad\\nenough, but colossally worse was the invasion of the Osmanli. Truly 'a\\nfruitful land maketh He barren, for the wickedness of them that dwell\\ntherein.'\\n\\nBut the potentiality for production of that great alluvial plain is not\\ndiminished; the Turks could not dispose of that by massacre, as a means\\nof weakening the strength of their subject peoples. It is still there,\\nready to respond to the spell of the waters of Tigris and Euphrates,\\nwhich once, when handled and controlled, caused it to be the Garden of\\nthe Lord.\\n\\nNot long before the present European War Sir William Willcocks, under\\nwhose guidance the great modern irrigation works at Assouan were\\nconstructed, was appointed adviser to the Ottoman Ministry of Public\\nWorks, and his report on the Irrigation of Mesopotamia was issued in\\n1911. He tells us that the whole of this delta of the Sawad is capable\\nof easy levelling and reclamation. It would naturally be a gigantic\\nscheme, and he takes as a basis to start on the question of the\\nrefertilisation of 4,000,000 acres. Into the details of it we need not\\ngo, but his conclusions, calculated on a thoroughly conservative basis,\\ngive the following results. He proposes to restore, of course with\\nmodern technical improvements, the old system of canals, and, allowing\\nfor interest on loans, estimates the total expense at L26,000,000 (or\\nthe cost of the war for about three days). On this the annual value of\\nthe crops would pay 31 per cent. The figures need no enlargement in\\ndetail and no comment.\\n\\nBut now comes the difficulty: the construction of the irrigation works\\nis easy, the profits are safe so long as the Tigris and 'the ancient\\nriver,' the river Euphrates, run their course. But all the irrigation\\nworks in the world will not raise a penny for the investor or a grain\\nfor the miller unless there are men to sow and gather the crops. A\\nmillion are necessary: where are they to come from? And the answer is\\n'Egypt and India.'\\n\\nThis is precisely why the protectorate of Mesopotamia and its future\\nmust be in English hands, why no other country can undertake it with\\nhope of success. Even the ingenious Dr. Rohrbach, whose _Bagdadbahn_ I\\nhave quoted before, is forced to acknowledge that there is no solution\\nto the man-power problem except by the 'introduction of Mohammedans from\\nother countries where the climatic conditions of Irak prevail.' It is\\ntrue that he starts upon the assumption that Mesopotamia will remain\\nTurkish (under a German protectorate, as we read between his lines),\\nwith which we must be permitted to disagree, but his conclusion is quite\\ncorrect. Even under German protection he realises that citizens of\\nwell-governed states will not flock by the million to put themselves\\nunder Turkish control, and he dismisses as inadequate the numbers of\\nSyrians, Arabs, Armenians and Jews who can be transported to Mesopotamia\\nfrom inside the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire. Their numbers are even\\nmore inadequate since the Armenian massacres permitted by Dr. Rohrbach's\\nFatherland, and even he cannot picture a million of his own countrymen\\nforsaking the beer-gardens for summers in the Sawad. He does not\\npositively state our answer, that it is from India and Egypt that the\\nman-power will be supplied, but, as mentioned before, I think he guesses\\nit. His prophetic gifts are not convincing enough to himself to let him\\nstate the glorious future, when India and Egypt shall become German, but\\nthat, I feel sure, is his vision: 'he sees it, but not now; he beholds\\nit, but not nigh.'\\n\\nBut we can give the answer which he does not quite like to state, since\\nfor the English it is clearly more easily realisable. The native labour\\nwe can supply from Egypt and India, especially India, will furnish a\\nmillion labourers, and, if we wished, two millions without difficulty.\\nBut no Power except England can furnish it. And that, I submit, is the\\nsolution of the problem of Mesopotamia; a solution well within the power\\nof English enterprise to attain in the hands of such men as have already\\nbridled the Nile, the water-horsemen of the world. And I cannot do\\nbetter, in trying to convey the spirit in which this work of\\nreclamation should be undertaken, than by quoting some very noble words\\nfrom Sir William Willcocks's report, in which he speaks of the\\ndesolation that has come to this garden of fruitfulness through wicked\\nstewardship.\\n\\n'The last voyage I made before coming to this country was up the Nile\\nfrom Khartoum to the Equatorial lakes. In this most desperate and\\nforbidding region I was filled with pride to think I belonged to a race\\nwhose sons, even in this inhospitable waste of waters, were struggling\\nin the face of a thousand discouragements to introduce new forest trees\\nand new agricultural products and ameliorate in some degree the\\nconditions of life of the naked and miserable inhabitants. How should I\\nhave felt, if in traversing the deserts and swamps which to-day\\nrepresent what was the richest and most famous tract in the world, I had\\nthought that I was the scion of a race in whose hands God has placed,\\nfor hundreds of years, the destinies of this great country, and that my\\ncountrymen could give no better account of their stewardship than the\\nexhibition of two mighty rivers flowing between deserts to waste\\nthemselves in the sea for nine months of the year, and desolating\\neverything in their way for the remaining three? No effort that Turkey\\ncan make can be too great to roll away the reproach of those parched and\\nweary lands, whose cry ascends to heaven.'\\n\\nBut the harvests of Mesopotamia, when gathered in, must needs be\\ntransported, and for that railways are necessary. Water transport would,\\nof course, carry them easily down to the Persian Gulf, but the supply\\nwill be mainly, if not wholly, wanted westwards, and it must be conveyed\\nto the shores of the Mediterranean. Already, in preparation for\\nworld-conquest, Germany has proceeded far with her construction of the\\nBagdad Railway, which was intended, after her absorption of Turkey, to\\nlink up Berlin with her next Oriental objective, namely, India; the\\nTaurus has been tunnelled, the Euphrates bridged, and but for a hiatus\\nof a few miles the line is practically complete from Constantinople into\\nNorthern Mesopotamia. But its route was chosen for German strategic\\nreasons, for the linking up of Berlin with Constantinople and Bagdad.\\nThis, it may be permitted to say, does not form part of the schemes of\\nthe Allies: it is to snap rather than weld such links that they have\\ntaken the field. What we want in the matter of railway transport for the\\nharvests of Mesopotamia, and generally for our Eastern communications,\\nis not a line that passes through Turkish and German soil, and\\nterminates at Berlin, but one which, after the directest possible\\nland-route, reaches the Mediterranean and terminates in suitable ports.\\n\\nThe reader therefore is requested to _unthink_ the present Bagdad\\nRailway altogether, to 'scrap' it in his mind, as it will be probably\\nscrapped on the map, since it is utterly useless for our purposes. For\\ntaking Aleppo as (roughly) the half-way house in the existent line, we\\nfind that the western half of it lies in Asia Minor, in territory which,\\nas we shall see, will remain Turkish, while the eastern half of it makes\\na long detour instead of striking directly for Bagdad. After our\\nexperience with Turkey there is nothing less conceivable than that we\\nshould allow a single mile of our new Mesopotamia Railway to run\\nthrough the territory of the Turks, for who knows that she might not\\n(say when harvests are ripe and ready for delivery), on any arbitrary\\npretext, close or destroy the line, even as before now she has closed\\nthe Dardanelles? Besides, for our purposes, a line that goes to\\nConstantinople (in whosoever hands Constantinople may be after the war)\\nis out of the way and altogether unsuitable. Eastwards, again, from\\nAleppo the present Bagdad line is circuitous and indirect, admirably\\nadapted to the German purposes for which it was constructed, but utterly\\nunadapted to ours.\\n\\nLet us then 'scrap' the existent Bagdad route altogether, and consider\\nnot what the Germans want, but what we want, which, as has been already\\nstated, is a direct land communication with suitable Mediterranean\\nports. Of those there are three obvious ones, Alexandretta, Tripoli, and\\nBeirut, of which Beirut is a long way the first in importance and\\npotentiality of increased importance. Two possible routes therefore\\nwould seem to suggest themselves, one running from Alexandretta to\\nAleppo, and thence following pretty closely the course of the Euphrates\\ntill it reaches Hit, and from there striking directly to Bagdad. Aleppo\\nis already connected with Tripoli and El Mina (the actual port of\\nTripoli), and also with Beirut by branch lines making a junction at\\nHoms, and thus all those ports will be brought together on one system.\\nBut if the reader will glance at the map, he will see that by far the\\nmost direct communication with Bagdad would be to run the railway direct\\nfrom there to Homs, thus making Homs rather than Aleppo the central\\njunction of the system. From Homs lines would run northward to Aleppo,\\ndue west to Tripoli, and south-west to Beirut. Either of those routes,\\nin any case, would be infinitely preferable to the long loop which the\\npresent Bagdad Railway traverses, as planned on German lines and for\\nGerman requirements. The new railway will thus lie exclusively in\\nterritory under French and English protectorate, and will probably be\\ntheir joint enterprise and property.\\n\\nProspectively then, as regards the fulfilment of the solemn pledge of\\nthe Allies to liberate subject peoples from the murderous tyranny of the\\nTurks, we have discussed the future of Armenia, of Syria, of Palestine,\\nand of Mesopotamia. All those are well defined districts, and the\\ndemarcation of their respective protectorates should not present great\\ndifficulties. But there remains, before we pass on to the problem of\\nConstantinople, a further district less easily defined, largely\\ninhabited by European peoples whose liberty in the future we are pledged\\nto secure. This is the Mediterranean coastline to the south and west of\\nAsia Minor, the towns of which have been so extensively peopled and made\\nprosperous by Greeks and Italians. Similarly among those of our European\\nAllies who are desirous and capable of Eastern expansion, there remains\\none, Italy, whose rights to partake in this Turkish partition we have\\nnot yet considered. In the shifting kaleidoscope of national\\nwar-politics, it seems at the moment of writing by no means impossible\\nthat Greece, having at length got rid of a treacherous and unstable\\nReuben of a monarch, may redeem her pledge to Serbia, in which case, no\\ndoubt, she too would state the terms of her desired and legitimate\\nexpansion. But these would more reasonably be concerned with the\\nredistribution of the Balkan Peninsula, which does not come within the\\nscope of this book, and we may prophesy without fear of invoking the\\nNemesis that so closely dogs the heels of seers, that Italy will\\nlegitimately claim (or perhaps has already claimed) the protectorate of\\nthis valuable littoral. Certain it is that, when peace returns, the\\nlarge population of Greeks and Italians once resident (and soon again to\\nbe) on these coasts, must be given the liberty and security which they\\nwill never enjoy so long as they remain in Turkish hands, and the hands\\nthat have earned the right to be protecting Power are assuredly Italian.\\nAlong the south coast a line including the Taurus range would seem to\\nsuggest a natural frontier inland from Adana on the east to the\\nsouth-west corner of Asia Minor, and from there a similar strip would\\npass up the coast as far as, and inclusive of, Smyrna. That at least\\nItaly has every right to expect, and there seems no great fear that\\namong the International Councils there will arise a dissentient voice.\\nThe inland boundary on the west coast is the difficult section of this\\ndelimitation, and into the details of that it would be both rash and\\ninexpedient to enter.\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\nWe pass, then, to the second avowed object of the Allies, namely, the\\nexpulsion from Europe of the Ottoman rule, which has proved itself so\\nradically alien to Western civilisation. This must be taken to include\\nnot only the expulsion of the Turkish control from Thrace and\\nConstantinople, but from the eastern side as well of the Bosporus, the\\nSea of Marmora, and the Dardanelles. At no future time must Turkey be in\\na position to command even partially a single yard of that momentous\\nchannel through which alone our Allies, Russia and Rumania, have access\\nto the Mediterranean. Though this was not formally stated in the Allies'\\nreply to President Wilson, it is clearly part and parcel of the object\\nin view, for while the Ottoman Empire retains the smallest control on\\neither side of either of the Straits, she is so far able to interfere in\\nEuropean concerns, in which she must never more have a hand. The east\\nshore, then, of the Straits and the Sea of Marmora, as well as the west,\\nmust be under the control of a Power, or a group of Powers, not alien to\\nWestern civilisation. Germany and her allies therefore, no less than\\nTurkey, must be excluded from the guardianship of the Straits.\\n\\nAs we have had previous occasion to note, this ejection of the Turkish\\npower from Constantinople is the absolute reversal of European and, in\\nespecial, of English policy for the last hundred years. No crime that\\nthe Ottoman Government could commit, no act of barbarism, would ever\\npersuade us to do away with the anachronism of Turkey's existence in\\nEurope; but at last the seismic convulsion of the war has knocked this\\npolicy into a heap of disjected ruins, and it can never be rebuilt again\\non the old lines. For among our other avowed objects in prosecuting the\\nwar to its victorious end, we have pledged ourselves to uphold the\\nright which all peoples, whether small or great, have to the enjoyment\\nof full security and free economic development. But while Turkey can\\nclose the Straits at her own arbitrary will, or at the bidding of a\\nsuperior and malevolent Power, and block the passage of ships from\\nRussian and Rumanian ports into the Mediterranean, the economic\\ndevelopment of both these countries is seriously menaced. Three times\\nwithin the last six years has she exercised that right, and while she\\nholds the shores of the Straits she can at any moment blockade all\\nsouthern Russian ports. That such power should be in the hands of any\\nnation is highly undesirable; that it should be in the hands of a\\ncorrupt despotism like Turkey, especially now that Germany, as things\\nstand, can dictate to Turkey when and what she pleases, is a thing\\nunthinkable by the most improvident of statesmen. Already we have paid\\ndearly enough for the pusillanimity of a hundred years: it is impossible\\nthat we should ever allow a similar bill to be again presented.\\nWhatever be the guardianship of the Straits, whoever the holder of\\nConstantinople, it will not be Turkey.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the war, and indeed till after the revolution in\\nRussia, it was announced and stated as an axiom that on the conclusion\\nof peace, Russia should be the door-keeper of what after all is her own\\nlodge-gate. Subsequently, in the unhappy splits and disintegration of\\nher Government, it was announced that she favoured peace without\\nannexation--in other words, that she neither claimed nor desired the\\nguardianship of Constantinople. But I think we should be utterly wrong\\nif we regarded that as an expression of the will of the Russian people:\\nit is far more probable that it was the expression of the will of\\nGermany, directly inspired by German influence with a view to concluding\\na separate peace with Russia. As we have seen, it had its due effect in\\nTurkey, and Talaat Bey gave vent to pious ejaculations of thanksgiving,\\nthat now all cause of quarrel with Russia was removed, and Turkey and\\nshe could be friends. It is possible that when out of the confused\\ncries there again rises from Russia the clear call of the people's\\nvoice, we shall find her wishing to set in order her own house before\\nshe projects herself on new missions, but, as far as the manifesto of\\n'peace without territorial annexation' goes, we shall be wise to regard\\nit for the present with the profoundest suspicion. It sounds far more\\nlike the tones of the Central European wolf than those of Little Red\\nRiding Hood's proper grandmother.\\n\\nBut be Russia's decision what it may, the Turk will hold sway no longer\\nin Thrace or Constantinople, or on the shores of the Straits of the Sea\\nof Marmora. There is, of course, no question of deporting the whole of\\nthe Turkish population that lives in those regions, nor would it be\\ndesirable, even if it were possible, to realise Gladstone's robust\\nvision of seeing every Turk, 'bag and baggage,' clear out from the\\nprovinces they have desolated and profaned. But if not under Russia,\\nthen under the joint control of certain of the Allied Powers there will\\nbe a complete reconstruction of the administration of those districts.\\nThe headquarters of the protectorate will doubtless be at\\nConstantinople, which will be reorganised somewhat on the lines of the\\nTreaty Port of Shanghai, and will be open to the ships of all nations.\\nThe security of the town must be assured by a military garrison either\\nof mixed troops of the controlling nations, or possibly by a rotation of\\ntroops drawn from the armies of each in turn. More important even than\\nthis will be the adequate control of the Straits by sea. A naval base\\nmust be formed, which by the gospel of the freedom of the seas (but not\\naccording to St. Goeben and the submarine disciples) will constitute a\\npatrolling police force of the waters. Whether the system of\\nfortifications and defences that lately rendered the Dardanelles\\nimpregnable shall be retained or not is a question demanding the most\\ncareful consideration. Some will hold that they should be maintained in\\norder to insure that none but the guarantors of the freedom of the\\nStraits shall ever take possession of them: others that they shall be\\nutterly dismantled and destroyed, so that the closing of the Straits\\nshall be an impossibility. The matter really turns on the question as to\\nthe extent to which the Allies will have the prudence to cut Germany's\\nclaws when the war is over. It is eminently to be hoped that they will\\nbe cut so short that never again will they be able to show those\\nchiselled talons beyond her velvet--that sense, in fact, will allow\\nsentiment no word to say. Unfortunately, there are a great many people\\nthe basis of whose character consists of a washy confidence in the good\\nintentions of everybody. Most mistakenly they call it Christianity.\\n\\nHere, then, has been outlined the effect of the Allies' declared aims.\\nSuch territories as Turkey holds in Europe, such control as she\\npossesses over the free passage of the Straits must pass from her, and\\nthe alien peoples, who for centuries have fainted and bled underneath\\nher infamous yoke, must be led out of the land of bondage. As we have\\nseen throughout preceding chapters, it was the fixed policy of the\\nOttoman Government to rid itself of their presence, and already it has\\ngone far in its murderous mission. Indeed the avowed aims of the\\nAllies, when accomplished, will do that work for her, for the Allies are\\ndetermined to remove those peoples from Turkey. The difference of\\nexecution, however, consists in this, that they will not remove Arabs\\nand Greeks and Italians and Jews, as Turkey has already done with the\\nArmenians by the simple process of massacres, but by a process no less\\nsimple, namely, of taking out of the territories of the Ottoman Empire\\nthe districts where such peoples dwell. The Allies will accomplish, in\\nfact, for the Turks that policy of Ottomanisation which was the aim of\\nAbdul Hamid, and has been the aim of his more murderous successors.\\nTurkey shall henceforth be for the Turks: she shall no more be in\\n'danger' from the defenceless nations, who at present exist within her\\nborders. The Sultan of Turkey, in some year of grace now not far\\ndistant, will find that his Ottomanisation has been done for him, and,\\nthough his realm is curtailed, he will have his rest broken no more by\\nthe thought of Arab risings, nor will he have to devise measures that\\nwill solve the Arab question. Except for a strip along the west and\\nsouth coast, all Asia Minor and Anatolia will be his from the Black Sea\\nto the Mediterranean, but Syria, Armenia, the coast of Asia Minor,\\nPalestine, and Mesopotamia shall have passed from him. It is no\\ndismemberment of an Empire that the Allies contemplate, for they cannot\\ndismember limbs that never belonged to the real trunk. It was a despotic\\nmilitary control that the Osmanlis had established, they always regarded\\ntheir subject peoples as aliens, whom they did not scruple to destroy if\\nthey exhibited symptoms of progress and civilisation. Henceforth the\\nTurkish Government shall govern Turks, and Turks alone. That for many\\nyears has been its aim, and, by the disastrous dispensation of fate, it\\nhas been largely able to realise its purpose. Now, though by different\\nmethods, the Allies will see thorough accomplishment of it. There will\\nbe no question, of course, of turning out or of deporting Turks who live\\nin Syria, in Armenia, in Constantinople, for the ways of the Allies are\\nnot those of Talaat and Enver and Jemal the Great. Where to-day Turks\\ndwell, there shall they continue to dwell, but they must dwell there in\\npeace in equal liberties and rights with the once-subject peoples whom\\nthe Allies shall have delivered. If they do not like that they can\\nmigrate, not by forced marches and under the guardianship of murderous\\nKurds, but in protection and security, to the lands where they can still\\nenjoy the beneficent sway of their own governors, and be Ottomanised to\\nthe top of their bent. But Syrians and Armenians and Greeks and Jews\\nwill be Ottomanised no longer.\\n\\nThe Turk was always a fighter, disciplined and courageous, and he has\\nnever lost that virtue of valour. But he has been a fighter because he\\nhas always lived under a military despotism which demanded his services,\\nand it is much to be doubted whether his qualities in this regard will\\nfor the future be exercised as they have been in the past. For the\\nTurkish armies, in so far as they have consisted of Turks, have been\\nchiefly, if not wholly, recruited from the peasantry of Anatolia, who,\\nwhen not summoned to their country's colours, or ordered to maltreat and\\nmassacre, are quiet, rather indolent folk, content to plough their lands\\nand reap an exiguous but sufficient harvest. And for their lords and\\ngovernors, who, until Prussia assumed command of the Turkish armies,\\nthere will no longer be either the possibility of further conquests as\\nin the old Osmanli days, or, in less progressive times, the necessity\\nfor securing Ottoman supremacy over the huge ill-knit lands which it\\ngoverned. But now, instead of having alien and defenceless tribes within\\ntheir borders, tribes forbidden to bear arms and chafing at the Turkish\\nyoke, they will see free peoples under the protectorates of Powers that\\nare capable of self-defence and, if necessary, of inflicting punishment.\\nRussia, France, England, Italy, all allied nations, will be established\\nin close proximity to the Turkish frontiers, and the New Turkey will be\\nas powerless for aggression as she will be for defence, should she\\nprovoke attack. But within their borders there may the Osmanlis dwell\\nsecure and undisturbed, so long as they conform to the habits of\\ncivilised people with regard to their neighbours, and it is a question\\nwhether, now that the military despotism which has always misguided the\\nfortunes of this people, has no possible fields for conquest, and no\\nneed of securing security, the nation will not settle down into the\\nquiet existence of small neutral countries. Perhaps the last chapter of\\nits savage and blood-stained history is already almost finished, and in\\nyears to come some little light of progress and of civilisation may be\\nkindled in the abode where the household gods for centuries have been\\ncruelty and hate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_Crescent and Iron Cross, Chapter VII_\\n\\n\\nTHE GRIP OP THE OCTOPUS\\n\\nIt will not be sufficient for the fulfilment of the Allies' aims as\\nregards Turkey to free from her barbarous control the subject peoples\\ndwelling within her borders, for Turkey herself has to be delivered from\\na domination not less barbaric than her own, which, if allowed to\\ncontinue, would soon again be a menace to the peace of the world. We\\nhave seen in a previous chapter how deeply set in her are Germany's\\nnippers, how closely the octopus-embrace envelops her, and we now have\\nto consider how those tentacles must be unloosed from their grip, and\\nwhat will be the condition of the victim, already bled white, when that\\nhas been done. In the beginning, as we have seen, Germany obtained her\\nhold by professing a touchingly beautiful and philanthropic desire to\\nhelp Turkey to realise her national ideals, and her Pecksniffs, Tekin\\nAlp and Herr Ernst Marre, were bidden to write parallel histories, the\\none describing the aims of the Nationalist party, the other the\\nbenevolent interest which Germany took in them. Occasionally Herr Ernst\\nMarre could not but remember that he was a German, and permitted us to\\nsee the claws of the cat, without quite letting it out of the bag, but\\nthen he pulled the strings tight again, and only loud comfortable\\npurrings could be heard, the Prussian musings over the 'liberation' of\\nTurkey which she was helping to accomplish. But nowadays, so it seems to\\nme, the strings have been loosened, and the claws and teeth are clearly\\nvisible. It is not so long since Dr. Schnee, Governor of German East\\nAfrica, sent a very illuminating document to Berlin from which I extract\\nthe following:--\\n\\n'Do you consider it possible to make a regulation prohibiting Islam\\naltogether? The encouragement of pig-breeding among natives is\\nrecommended by experts as an effective means of stopping the spread of\\nIslam....'\\n\\nThat seems clear enough, and I can imagine Talaat Bey, with his sword\\nof honour in his hand, exclaiming with the Oysters in _Alice in\\nWonderland_:--\\n\\n'After such kindness that would be\\n  A dismal thing to do.'\\n\\nBut I am afraid that Germany is contemplating (as indeed she has always\\ndone) a quantity of dismal things to do, and is now, like the Walrus and\\nthe Carpenter, beginning to let them appear. She has taken the Turkish\\noysters out for a nice long walk, and when the war is over she proposes\\nto sit down and eat them. And did she not also interfere in the affair\\nof Jewish massacres and declare that 'Pan-Turkish ideals have no sort of\\nmeaning in Palestine'? That must have been almost an unfriendly act from\\nTurkey's point of view, for it cannot be stated too clearly that part of\\nthe price which Germany paid for Turkey's entry on her side into the\\nwar, was the liberty, as far as Germany was concerned, of managing her\\ninternal affairs, massacres and the rest, as best suited the damnable\\ndoctrines of Ottomanisation. The other Powers could not interfere, for\\nthey failed to force the Dardanelles, and Germany promised not to. That\\npromise, of course, was binding on Germany for just so long as it suited\\nher to keep it, and it suited her to keep it, on the whole, during the\\nArmenian massacres. And in that matter her refusal to interfere is,\\namong all her crimes, the very flower and felicity of her vileness.\\n\\nSigns are not wanting that Turkey is beginning to realise the position\\nin which she has placed herself, namely, that of a bankrupt dependant at\\nthe mercy of a nation to whom that quality is a mere derision. Lately a\\nquantity of small incidents have occurred, such as disputes over the\\nownership of properties financed by Germany and the really melodramatic\\ndepreciation in the German coinage, which unmistakably show the swift\\nebb of Turkey's misplaced confidence. More significant perhaps than any\\nis a transaction that took place in May 1917, when Talaat Bey and Enver\\nPasha took the whole of their private fortunes out of the Deutsche Bank\\nin Constantinople, and invested them in two Swiss banks, namely, the\\nBanque Nationale de Suisse, and the Banque Federale: they drew out also\\nthe whole funds of the Committee of Union and Progress, and similarly\\ntransferred them. This operation was not effected without loss, for in\\nreturn for the Turkish L1 they received only thirteen francs. But it is\\nsignificant that they preferred to lose over fifty per cent. of their\\ncapital, and have the moiety secure in Switzerland to leaving it in\\nConstantinople.[1] It is certain therefore that at both ends of the\\nscale a distrust of German management has begun. A starving population\\nhas wrecked trains loaded with food-stuffs going to Germany, and at the\\nother end the men with the swords of honour and dishonour deem it wise\\nto put their money out of reach of the great Prussian cat. That the\\nGermans themselves are not quite at their ease concerning the security\\nof their hold may also be conjectured, for they are, as far as possible,\\nremoving Turkish troops from Constantinople, and replacing them with\\ntheir own regiments. An instance of this occurred in June 1917, when,\\nowing to the discontent in the capital, it was found necessary to guard\\nbridges, residences of Ministers, and Government offices. But instead of\\nrecalling Turkish troops from Galicia to do this, they kept them there\\nin the manner of hostages, mixed up in German regiments, and sent picked\\nbodies of German troops to Constantinople. Fresh corps of secret police\\nhave also been formed to suppress popular manifestations. They are\\nallowed to 'remove' suspects by any means they choose, quite in the old\\nstyle of bag and Bosporus, but the organisation of them is German. And\\nwell may the German Government distrust those signs of popular\\ndiscontent in a starving population: already the people have awoke to\\nthe fact that the German paper money does not represent its face-value,\\nand, despite assurances to the contrary, it is at a discount scarcely\\ncredible. Three German L1 notes are held even in Constantinople to be\\nthe equivalent of a gold L1, while in the provinces upwards of five are\\nasked for, and given, in exchange for one gold pound. It is in vain that\\nGerman manifestoes are put forth declaring that all Government offices\\nwill take the notes as an equivalent for gold, for what the people want\\nis not a traffic with Government offices, but the cash to buy food. Even\\nmore serious is the fact that Austrian and Hungarian directors of banks\\nwill no longer accept these scraps of paper. In vain, too, is it that\\nthe hungry folk see the walls of the 'House of Friendship' rise higher\\nand higher in Constantinople, for every day they see with starving eyes\\nthe trains loaded with sugar from Konia, and the harvests raised in\\nAnatolia with German artificial manures guarded by German troops and\\nrolling westwards to Berlin. According to present estimates the harvest\\nthis year is so vastly more abundant than that of previous years, that\\nno comparison, as the Minister of Agriculture tells his gratified\\nGovernment, is possible. But the poorer classes get no more than the\\nleavings of it when the armies, which include the German army, have had\\ntheir wants supplied. The governing classes, whom it is necessary to\\nfeed, are not yet suffering, for the Germans grant them enough, issuing\\nrations to such families as are proved adherents of the German-Turkish\\ncombination, and until the pinch of want attacks them we should be\\nfoolishly optimistic if we thought that a starving peasantry would cause\\nthe collapse or the defection of Germany's newest and most valuable\\ncolony. There is enough discontent to make Germany uneasy, but that is\\nall.[2] Long ago she proved the efficiency of her control, and the\\nsuccessful pulling of her puppet-strings, and no instance of that is\\nmore complete than the brief story of Yakub Jemil and the extinction of\\nhim and his party, which, though it happened a full year ago, has only\\nlately been completely transmitted. Yakub Jemil was an influential\\ncommander of a frontier guard near the Black Sea coast. In July 1916 he\\nwent to Constantinople, accompanied by his staff (which included the\\ninformant from whom this account is derived), and, being cordially\\nreceived by Enver and Talaat, discussed the situation with them. He\\npointed out the demoralising effect of the Armenian massacres, and the\\ndanger of Jemal the Great's attitude towards the Arabs in Syria,\\nrealising, and seeking to make them realise, the stupendous folly of\\nmaking enemies of the subject peoples, and urging the re-establishment\\nof cordial relations between the Turks and them. That, considering that\\nEnver and Talaat were responsible (under the Germans) for the Armenian\\nmassacres, was a brave outspeaking. He went on to say that Turkey was at\\nwar not on behalf of herself, but on behalf of Germany, and that it\\nwould be wise of the Government to consider the possibility of a\\nseparate peace with the Powers of the Entente. He was heard with\\ninterest, and took his leave. He remained in Constantinople, and his\\nviews obtained him many adherents, not only among Turkish officers whose\\nsympathies were already alienated from Germany, but among members of the\\nCommittee of Union and Progress. But before long his adherents began to\\ndisappear, and he asked for another interview with Talaat. He was\\nreceived, as the informant states, 'with open arms,' for Talaat seized\\nand held him, called for the guard, and he was searched, and on him were\\nfound certain documents which proved him to hold the views he had\\nalready expressed. That now, was enough. He was 'interrogated' for two\\ndays (interrogation is otherwise called torture), and was then hanged.\\nSubsequently 111 officers and men in the army also disappeared. Some\\nwere marched into the Khiat Khana Valley, opposite Pera, and were\\nstabbed: others were sent under escort to the provinces and murdered. No\\ncourts-martial of any kind were held.\\n\\n[Footnote 1: Similarly, in October of this year, a new Turkish law was\\npassed, prohibiting the acquisition of Turkish land by foreign settlers.\\nThis is aimed point-blank at Germany, and has naturally annoyed Berlin\\nvery much.]\\n\\n[Footnote 2: The army rations have lately been reduced, each Turkish\\nsoldier receiving daily an oke of bread and a dried mackerel.]\\n\\nAnd should anybody doubt the efficiency of German control in Turkey, and\\nbe disposed to be optimistic about the imminence of Turkey's detachment,\\nhe might do well to ponder that story.\\n\\nMeantime the efficacy of our naval blockade is largely discounted by\\nGermany's new source of supply. Possibly in the ensuing winter of\\n1917-18 conditions may get unbearable, but if the Turkish Government\\nonly two years ago massacred more than a million of its subjects, it\\nwould be absurd to expect that the starving of a million more would\\nproduce much effect on the Ministers of the Turkish God of Love.[1] The\\npeople are, of course, told, with suitable statistics, how famine is\\ndecimating England and France, and how the total starvation of those\\nunfortunate countries is imminent. Indeed, of all the signs of want of\\nconfidence in their German overlords, by far the most promising are the\\nfacts that Talaat and Enver have sent their money out of the country,\\nand that Jemal the Great has a swelled head. On these facts there is a\\ncertain justifiable optimism to be based. It will do no good to consider\\nthem academically in London; but are there not practical channels to\\nreach the instincts of the Turkish triumvirate that might be navigated?\\n\\n[Footnote 1: The following list of prices in Constantinople is of\\ninterest:--\\n\\n                  July 1914.

But the economical\\nfuture of Turkey is not so plain: at the present moment its bankruptcy\\nis total. Early in the war Germany drained it of such bullion as it had,\\nand has since then advanced it about L150,000,000, which, as far as I\\ncan trace, is entirely in German paper, and must be redeemed in gold at\\nsome period (chiefly two years) after the end of the war. That is\\nwonderful finance, and one marvels that Turkey could have been so far\\nblinded as to accept it. But I expect that the swallowing of the first\\nloan was sweetened by a spoonful of jam of this kind. Germany pointed\\nout that, though England was quite certainly going to lose the war, she\\nhad issued an immense paper coinage which had all the purchasing power\\nof gold. Germany, on the other hand, with her dear Ally to help her, was\\njust as certainly going to win the war. How, then, could there be the\\nslightest risk of the German paper money depreciating a single piastre\\nin value? That sounded very good sense to Turkey, who was equally\\nconvinced that she would be on the victorious side (else she would not\\nhave joined it), and down went the loan with a pleasant sensation of\\nsweetness. A second loan was easily induced by the failure of the\\nDardanelles expedition, and about then the 'ignorant' Turkish peasant\\nbegan to wonder whether the paper was quite as valuable as gold, and to\\nprefer gold or even the ordinary silver piastre to its German\\nequivalent. To counteract that, as we have seen, a law was passed making\\nit criminal to hoard gold, and, to complete the ruin, the silver piastre\\nwas called in, and a nickel token was substituted.... We can but bow our\\nheads in reverence of the thoroughness of German swindling.\\n\\nNow Turkey is completely bankrupt, and we must ask ourselves why Germany\\never bargained for the repayment in gold, after the war, of the millions\\nshe had lent the Turks in paper, if she knew that Turkey could never\\nrepay her. True, the loans had only cost her the paper the notes were\\nprinted on, so that in no case could she prove a loser, but how could\\nshe be a gainer? The answer to that question shouts at us from every\\nacre of Turkish soil. The immense undeveloped riches of Turkey supply\\nthe answer. Some indeed are already being developed, and the labour and\\nmost of the materials have been paid for by the German paper notes.\\nThere are the irrigation works at Adana, there is the beet-sugar\\nindustry at Konia, the irrigation works in the Makischelin Valley, the\\nmineral concessions of the Bagdad Railway, the Haidar Pasha Harbour\\nconcessions, the afforestation scheme near Constantinople, the cotton\\nindustry in Anatolia--there is no end to them. Turkey may not be able to\\npay in cash, but over all these concessions already working, and over a\\nhundred more, of which the concessions have been granted, Germany has a\\ncomplete hold, and her victim will pay in minerals and cotton and sugar\\nand corn. She will pay over and over and over again, as none who have\\nthe smallest knowledge of Kultur-finance can possibly doubt. She is\\nbled white already, and for the rest of time bloodless and white will\\nshe remain. Only one event can possibly avert her fate, and that is the\\nvictory of the Allies.\\n\\nWe have been so bold as to assume that this is not an impossible\\ncontingency, and on that assumption there is a brighter future for\\nTurkey than the Prussian domination could ever bring her. Bankrupt she\\nis, but, as Germany saw, she is rich in possibilities even with regard\\nto the restricted territory to which she will surely find herself\\nlimited, and it is a pleasant chance for her that Germany has already\\nbeen so busy in developing the resources of Anatolia. For Germany may\\nsafely bet her last piece of paper money that she will not lay a finger\\non them.\\n\\nThe Turkey of the future is to be for the Turks; not for the persecuted\\nArmenians, nor for the Arabs, nor for the Greeks, and assuredly it is\\nnot to be for the Prussians. While the war lasts, Germany may draw\\nsupplies from the fields her artificial manures have enriched, and from\\nthe acres that her paper money has planted, but after that no more. Her\\nOttomanising work will be over. Such development (and it is far from\\nnegligible) as she has done in Syria will be continued under French\\nprotection for the Arabs, such as she has done in Mesopotamia under\\nEnglish protection, and such as she has done in Anatolia will be\\ncontinued by the Turks to drag them out of the utter insolvency that she\\nhas brought them to. Never before has a country so justly and so richly\\ndeserved the repudiation of a debt incurred by the confidence trick. Not\\na civilised Government in the world would dream of enforcing payment,\\nany more than a magistrate would enforce a payment to some\\nthimble-rigger returning from a race-meeting.\\n\\n\\nThe roar of battle still renders inaudible all voices save its own, but\\nalready the dusk begins to gather over the halls where sit the War-lord\\nand those who, for the realisation of their monstrous dreams, loosed\\nhell upon the world, and in the growing dusk there begin to steal upon\\nthe wall the letters of pale flame that to them portend the doom, and to\\nus give promise of dawn.

Very few,\\nI fear, except professional critics. And yet, the man who, forty\\nyears ago, became famous as Multatuli (I have borne much), was not\\nonly the greatest figure in the modern literature of the Netherlands,\\nbut one of the most powerful and original writers in the literature\\nof the world. An English critic has called him the Heine of Holland;\\nAnatole France calls him the Voltaire of the Netherlands.\\n\\nEduard Douwes Dekker was born in 1820, at Amsterdam, his father being\\nthe captain of a merchantman trading in the Dutch colonies. At the age\\nof eighteen Dekker sailed on his father's vessel for the East Indies,\\ndetermined to abandon the business career that had been mapped out for\\nhim and enter the colonial service. In 1839 he received a clerkship\\nin the civil service at Batavia. He now remained in the employ of\\nthe government for seventeen years, being promoted from one grade to\\nanother until he was made Assistant Resident of Lebak in 1856.\\n\\nIn this important position he used his influence to better the\\ncondition of the natives; but, to his sorrow, he soon found that he\\ndid not have the support of his superiors. What he conceived to be\\nright clashed with the line of conduct he was expected to follow. In\\na rash moment of \\\"righteous indignation\\\" he handed in his resignation;\\nand it was accepted.\\n\\nThis hasty step put an end to a brilliant political career and entailed\\nupon Dekker years of disappointment and hardship. Seeing that he was\\npursuing the wrong method to help either the Javanese, or himself,\\nhe immediately tried to get reinstated, but without success. In 1857\\nhe returned to Holland and applied to the home government, hoping to\\nbe vindicated and restored to his post. Again he was disappointed. The\\ngovernment offered him another desirable position; but, as it was a\\nmatter of principle with Dekker, he declined it.\\n\\nWhen he saw that it was useless to importune the government further,\\nDekker made his appeal to the people in \\\"Max Havelaar\\\" (1860). The book\\nwas an instant success and made the name of Multatuli famous. Through\\nthe perfidy of a supposed friend, however, Dekker failed to get very\\nsubstantial material rewards from this work. For ten years yet he\\nwas struggling with poverty.\\n\\nThe Bohemian life that Dekker was now compelled to live--his family\\nwas on the sufferance of friends--estranged him from his wife and\\nstrengthened what some might call an unfortunate--or, at least, an\\nuntimely--literary friendship that Dekker had formed with a certain\\nMiss Mimi Schepel, of The Hague. The spiritual affinity between the\\ntwo soon developed a passion that neither could resist. This estimable\\nlady, who afterwards became Dekker's second wife, is still living,\\nand has edited Dekker's letters in nine volumes. Dekker died in\\nFebruary, 1887, at his home in Nieder-Ingelheim, where he had lived\\nfor several years.\\n\\nThe \\\"Woutertje Pieterse\\\" story was first published in Dekker's\\nseven volume work entitled \\\"Ideen.\\\" Here it is sandwiched in between\\nmiscellaneous sketches, essays and treatises, being scattered all\\nthe way from Vol. I to Vol. VII. The story falls naturally into two\\nparts, of which the present volume is the first part. The second part,\\nwritten in a different key, deals with \\\"Walter's Apprenticeship.\\\"\\n\\nA good deal of the flax, or silk, of his Chinaman's pigtail, to use\\nDekker's form of expression, I have unraveled as being extraneous\\nmatter. However, despite these omissions, it is quite possible that\\nsome very sensitive person may still find objectionable allusions in\\nthe book. If so, I must refer that one to the shade of Multatuli. From\\nhis own admission his shoulders were evidently broad; and, no doubt,\\nthey will be able to bear the additional strain.\\n\\n\\n                                                        Hubert

So\\nit must have been before the discovery of Political Economy. Our\\nservant-girl married the barber's assistant, who had only one\\nleg. \\\"Such a saving of shoe-leather,\\\" the good little soul argued. But\\nfrom this fact one might infer that the science of Political Economy\\nhad already been discovered.\\n\\nAt all events, it was a long time ago. Amsterdam had no sidewalks,\\nimport duties were still levied, in some civilized countries there were\\nstill gallows, and people didn't die every day of nervousness. Yes,\\nit was a long time ago.\\n\\nThe Hartenstraat! I have never comprehended why this street should\\nbe called thus. Perhaps it is an error, and one ought to write\\nHertenstraat, or something else. I have never found more \\\"heartiness\\\"\\nthere than elsewhere; besides, \\\"harts\\\" were not particularly plentiful,\\nalthough the place could boast of a poulterer and dealer in venison.\\n\\nI haven't been there for a long time, and I only remember that the\\nStraat connects two main canal-streets, canals that I would fill up\\nif I had the power to make Amsterdam one of the most beautiful cities\\nof Europe.\\n\\nMy predilection for Amsterdam, our metropolis, does not make me\\nblind to her faults. Among these I would mention first her complete\\ninability to serve as the scene of things romantic. One finds here\\nno masked Dominos on the street, the common people are everywhere\\nopen to inspection, no Ghetto, no Templebar, no Chinese quarter,\\nno mysterious courtyard. Whoever commits murder is hanged; and the\\ngirls are called \\\"Mietje\\\" and \\\"Jansje\\\"--everything prose.\\n\\nIt requires courage to begin a story in a place ending with\\n\\\"dam.\\\" There it is difficult to have \\\"Emeranties\\\" and \\\"H\\u00e9loises\\\";\\nbut even these would be of little use, since all of these belles have\\nalready been profaned.\\n\\nHow do the French authors manage, though, to dress up their \\\"Margots\\\"\\nand \\\"Marions\\\" as ideals and protect their \\\"Henris\\\" and \\\"Ernestes\\\"\\nfrom the trite and trivial? These last remind one of M'sieu Henri or\\nM'sieu Erneste just about like our castle embankments remind one of\\nfilthy water.\\n\\nGoethe was a courageous man: Gretchen, Kl\\u00e4rchen----\\n\\nBut I, in the Hartenstraat!\\n\\nHowever, I am not writing a romance; and even if I should write one,\\nI don't see why I shouldn't publish it as a true story. For it is\\na true story, the story of one who in his youth was in love with a\\nsawmill and had to endure this torture for a long time.\\n\\nFor love is torture, even if it is only love for a sawmill.\\n\\nIt will be seen that the story is going to be quite simple, in fact\\ntoo frail to stand alone. So here and there I am going to plait\\nsomething in with the thread of the narrative, just as the Chinaman\\ndoes with his pigtail when it is too thin. He has no Eau de Lob or\\noil from Macassar--but I admit that I have never found at Macassar\\nany berries which yielded the required oil.\\n\\nTo begin, in the Hartenstraat was a book-shop and circulating\\nlibrary. A small boy with a city complexion stood on the step and\\nseemed to be unable to open the door. It was evident that he was\\ntrying to do something that was beyond his strength.\\n\\nHe stretched out his hand towards the door knob repeatedly, but\\nevery time he interrupted this motion either by stopping to pull\\nunnecessarily at a big square-cut collar that rested on his shoulders\\nlike a yoke, or by uselessly lifting his hand to screen an ingenuous\\ncough.\\n\\nHe was apparently lost in the contemplation of the pictures that\\ncovered the panes of glass in the door, turning them into a model\\nchart of inconceivable animals, four-cornered trees and impossible\\nsoldiers. He was glancing continually to one side, like a criminal\\nwho fears that he is going to be caught in the act. It was manifest\\nthat he had something in view which must be concealed from passers-by,\\nand from posterity, for that matter. His left hand was thrust under\\nthe skirts of his little coat, clutching convulsively at something\\nconcealed in his trousers pocket. To look at him one would have\\nthought that Walter contemplated a burglary, or something of the kind.\\n\\nFor his name was Walter.\\n\\nIt is a fortunate thing that it occurred to me to relate his history;\\nand now I consider it my duty to report that he was entirely innocent\\nof any burglarious or murderous intentions.\\n\\nI only wish I could clear him of other sins as easily as this. The\\nobject he was turning and twisting in his left breeches pocket was\\nnot a house-key, nor a jimmy, nor a club, nor a tomahawk, nor any\\ninfernal machine: It was a small piece of paper containing fourteen\\nstivers, which he had raised on his New Testament with Psalms at\\nthe grocer's on the \\\"Ouwebrug\\\"; and the thing that held him fast on\\nthe Hartenstraat was nothing more or less than his entrance into the\\nmagic world of romance. He was going to read \\\"Glorioso.\\\"\\n\\nGlorioso! Reader, there are many imitations, but only one Glorioso. All\\nthe Rinaldos and Fra Diavolos are not to be mentioned in the same\\nbreath with Glorioso, this incomparable hero who carried away\\ncountesses by the dozen, plundered popes and cardinals as if they\\nwere ordinary fallible people, and made a testament-thief of Walter\\nPieterse.\\n\\nTo be sure, Glorioso was not to blame for this last, certainly not. One\\nought to be ashamed to be a hero, or a genius, or even a robber, if\\non this account one is to be held responsible for all the crimes that\\nmay be committed years afterwards in the effort to get possession of\\none's history.\\n\\nI myself object to any accusation of complicity in those evil deeds\\nthat are committed after my death in quenching the thirst for knowledge\\nof my fate. Indeed, I shall never be deterred from a famous career\\nmerely by the thought that some one may sell the New Testament to\\nget hold of the \\\"Life and Deeds of Multatuli.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You rascal, what are you loitering around here for? If you want\\nanything, come in; if you don't, make yourself scarce.\\\"\\n\\nAnd now Walter had to go in, or else abandon his cherished\\nGlorioso. But the man who bent over the counter and twisted himself\\nlike a crane to open the door and snarl these words at our young hero\\ndid not have a face that advised anything like turning back. He was\\nangry. At first Walter had not had the courage to go in; now he did\\nnot dare to turn back. He felt himself drawn in. It was as if the\\nbook-shop swallowed him.\\n\\n\\\"Glorioso, if you please, M'neer, and here----\\\" He drew that infernal\\nmachine from his pocket. \\\"And here is money----\\\"\\n\\nFor he had learned from his schoolmates, who had infected him with\\nthis craving for romance, that at the circulating library strangers\\nmust deposit a forfeit.\\n\\nThe shopman seemed to regard himself as \\\"sufficiently protected\\\"\\nby the sum produced. He took down a small volume, which was greasy\\nand well worn, and bore both within and without the traces of much\\nunclean enjoyment.\\n\\nI am certain that the \\\"Sermons of Pastor Splitvesel,\\\" which stood\\nundisturbed on the top shelf and looked down contemptuously on\\nthe literature of the day, would have been ashamed to bring their\\nspotless binding into contact with so much uncleanliness. But it is\\nnot difficult to remain clean in the upper row. I find, therefore,\\nthat the \\\"sermons\\\" were unjust; and the same is true of many sermons.\\n\\nAfter Walter had given his name to the man in a trembling voice, he\\nstuck the reward of his misdeed under his coat and hurried out the\\ndoor, like a cat making away with the prey for which it has waited\\nfor hours.\\n\\nWalter ran and ran, and did not know where to go. He couldn't go home;\\nhe was watched too closely there,--which was not very difficult,\\nas the space was rather limited.\\n\\nHe selected quiet streets and finally came to a gateway that he\\nremembered to have seen several times. It was a low, smooth arch,\\nwhere it always smelled like ashes. Here, as a truant, he had taken\\nthat leap! He was with Franz Halleman, who had dared him to cut sacred\\nstudies and jump from the top of this arch. Walter did it just because\\nlittle Franz had questioned his courage.\\n\\nTo this escapade he was indebted for his great familiarity with the\\nprophet Habakkuk, whose prophecies he had to copy twelve times as\\na penalty. Further, the sprain that he got in his big toe on that\\noccasion gave him a good barometer in that organ, which always warned\\nhim of approaching rain.\\n\\nIn a certain sense Habakkuk is to be regarded as marking a transition\\nin Walter's life, viz. from nursery rhymes to books which deal with big\\npeople. For some time he had felt his admiration for \\\"brave Heinriche\\\"\\nto be growing; and he was disgusted with the paper peaches that are\\ndistributed as the reward of diligence in the beautiful stories. Of\\nany other peaches he had no knowledge, as the real article was never\\nseen in the houses he visited.\\n\\nNothing was more natural than that he should most ardently long to\\ntalk with the older schoolboys about the wonders of the real world,\\nwhere people ride in coaches, devastate cities, marry princesses,\\nand stay up in the evening till after 10 o'clock--even if it isn't a\\nbirthday. And then at the table one helps one's self, and may select\\njust whatever one wants to eat. So think children.\\n\\nEvery boy has his heroic age, and humanity, as a whole, has worn the\\nlittle coat with the big collar.\\n\\nBut how far can this comparison be carried? Where does the\\nidentity stop? Will the human race become mature? and more than\\nmature?--old? Feeble and childish?\\n\\nHow old are we now? Are we boys, youths, men? Or are we\\nalready----? No, that would be too unpleasant to think of.\\n\\nLet us suppose that we are just in the exuberance of youth! We are\\nthen no longer children exactly, and still we may hope something of\\nthe future.\\n\\nYes, of the future,--when this stifling school atmosphere has been\\nblown away. When we shall take pleasure in the short jacket of the boy\\nthat comes after us; when people will be at liberty to be born without\\nany legal permit, and will not be reviled for it; when humanity will\\nspeak one language; when metaphysics and religion have been forgotten,\\nand knowledge of nature takes the place of noble birth. When we shall\\nhave broken away from the nursery stories.\\n\\nThere is some silk for my Chinaman's pigtail. Some will say it is\\nonly flax.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\n\\nWalter thought neither of the heroic age nor of Chinese cues. Without\\nany feeling for the beauty of the landscape, he hurried along till\\nhe came to a bridge that spanned a marshy ditch. After looking about\\ncarefully to assure himself that he was alone, he selected this\\nbridge for his reading-room, and proceeded at once to devour his\\nrobber undisturbed.\\n\\nFor a moment I felt tempted to make the reader a participant of\\nWalter's pleasure by giving a sketch of the immortal work that chained\\nthe boy's attention. But aside from the fact that I am not very well\\nversed in Glorioso--which fact of itself, though, would not prevent me\\nfrom speaking about him--I have many other things of a more urgent\\nnature to relate, and am compelled therefore to take the reader\\ndirectly to the Hartenstraat, hoping that he will be able to find\\nhis way just as well as if he had crossed the Ouwebrug--the old bridge.\\n\\nSuffice it to say that Walter found the book \\\"very nice.\\\" The virtuous\\nAmalia, in the glare of flaring torches, at the death-bed of her\\nrevered mother, in the dismal cypress valley, swearing that her ardent\\nlove for the noble robber--through the horrible trapdoor, the rusty\\nchains, her briny tears--in a word, it was stirring! And there was\\nmore morality in it, too, than in all the insipid imitations. All the\\nmembers of the band were married and wore gloves. In the cave was\\nan altar, with wax tapers; and those chapters in which girls were\\nabducted always ended with a row of most decorous periods, or with\\nmysterious dashes--which Walter vainly held up to the light in his\\neffort to learn more about it.\\n\\nHe read to: \\\"Die, betrayer!\\\" Then it was dark, and he knew that it\\nwas time to go home. He was supposed to be taking a walk with the\\nHalleman boys,--who were \\\"such respectable children.\\\" With regret he\\nclosed the precious volume and hurried away as fast as he could, for\\nhe was afraid he was going to get a whipping for staying away so long.\\n\\n\\\"You will never get permission again\\\"--thus he was always threatened\\non such occasions. But he understood, of course, that they didn't mean\\nit. He knew too well that people like to get rid of the children for\\na while when they are a little short of space at home. And then the\\nlittle Hallemans were \\\"such extraordinarily respectable children;\\nthey lived next to a house with a portico, and recently they had\\ntaken off their little caps so politely.\\\"\\n\\nNow, I don't believe that the Hallemans were any more respectable\\nthan other boys of Walter's acquaintance; and, as I would like to\\ngive some reasons for my belief, I am going to relate an incident\\nthat had happened some time before this.\\n\\nWalter never got any pocket-money. His mother considered this\\nunnecessary, because he got at home everything that he needed. It\\nmortified him to have to wait for an invitation to join in a game\\nof ball with his companions, and then be reminded that he had\\ncontributed nothing towards buying the ball. In Walter's time that\\nuseful instrument of sport cost three doits--just a trifle. Now\\nI suppose they are more expensive--but no, cheaper, of course, on\\naccount of Political Economy.\\n\\nOn many occasions he was depressed by reason of this lack of money. We\\nshall see later whether what his mother said was true, or not: that he\\nreceived at home everything he needed. It is certain that at home he\\nnever had the privilege of doing with some little thing as he pleased,\\nwhich is very nice for children. And for grown-up people, too.\\n\\nThe Hallemans--who were so especially respectable--gave him to\\nunderstand that they had no desire to bear all the expenses. Franz\\ncalculated that Walter's friendship had already cost them nine\\nstivers, which I find high--not for the friendship, but merely\\nas an estimate. Gustave said it was still more; but that is a\\ndetail. Gustave, too, had let him have four slate pencils, that he\\nmight court \\\"the tall Cecilia,\\\" who wouldn't have anything to do with\\nhim because he wore a jacket stuck in his trousers--the kind small\\nboys wore then. She accepted the pencils, and then made Gustave a\\npresent of them for a kiss.\\n\\nThe reproaches of the little Hallemans, who were so very respectable,\\nalmost drove Walter to despair.\\n\\n\\\"I have told my mother, but she won't give me anything.\\\"\\n\\nThe little Hallemans, who were so respectable, said: \\\"What's that\\nyou're giving us? You're a parasite.\\\"\\n\\nThis was the first time Walter had ever heard the word, but he knew\\nwhat it meant. Nothing sharpens the wits like bitterness of heart.\\n\\n\\\"A parasite, a parasite--I'm a parasite,\\\" and he ran off screaming,\\nmaking a detour in order to avoid the street where Cecilia's father\\nhad a second-hand store. Oh, if she had seen him running through\\nthe street crying like a baby--that would have been worse than the\\nbreeches pulled up over his jacket!\\n\\nA parasite, a parasite!\\n\\nHe met lots of grown-up people who perhaps were parasites, but they\\nwere not bawling on this account.\\n\\nParasite!\\n\\nHe saw a policeman, and caught his breath when he got by him, surprised\\nthat the man hadn't arrested him.\\n\\nParasite!\\n\\nThen came a street-sweeper with his cart, who seemed to rattle that\\nhateful word after him.\\n\\nOur little sufferer remembered that the Halleman boys had once told\\nhim what a fortune could be made by peddling peppermint drops. For\\ntwenty-four stivers one could buy a big sack full. By selling so\\nand so many for a doit, the profit would be enormous. If one only\\nhad the capital to begin! The Hallemans had calculated everything\\nvery exactly; for they were not only very respectable, but also very\\ncunning. Cunningness and respectability usually go hand in hand. They\\nhad said, all that was needed was the capital. They would attend to\\nlaying in the stock, and would assume all responsibility for the sale\\nof the same. If Walter would chip in just a florin, they could raise\\nthe rest and all would go well.\\n\\nParasite.... Parasite....\\n\\nWalter slipped a florin from his mother's box of savings and brought\\nit to the Halleman boys, who were so remarkably respectable.\\n\\n\\\"Where did you get it?\\\" asked Gustave, but careful not to give Walter\\ntime to answer, or to fall into an embarrassing silence.\\n\\n\\\"Where did you get it?\\\"--without any interrogation point--\\\"fine! Franz\\nand I will each add one like it. That'll make twenty-four, and then\\nwe'll buy the peppermints. There's a factory on the Rosengracht--such\\na sack for four shillings. Franz and I will do everything. We'll\\nhave more opportunity at school, you understand. Christian Kloskamp\\nhas already ordered twelve; he'll pay after the holidays. We'll take\\nall the trouble; you needn't do anything, Walter--and then an equal\\ndivide. You can depend upon it.\\\"\\n\\nWalter went home and dreamed of unheard-of wealth. He would put a\\ndollar in his mother's savings-bank, and buy for Cecilia a lead pencil\\nfrom the man who had picked holes in the wood-work of his wagon with\\nthem. So strong were they! That would be something entirely different\\nfrom those slate pencils; and if the tall Cecilia still wouldn't\\nhave him, then--but Walter did not care to think further. There are\\nabysses along the path of fancy that we do not dare to sound. We see\\nthem instinctively, close the eyes and--I only know that on that\\nevening Walter fell asleep feeling good, expecting soon to have a\\ngood conscience over his little theft and hoping that Cecilia would\\ngive him a happy heart.\\n\\nAlas, alas! Little Walter had made his calculations without taking into\\nconsideration the slyness and respectability of the Hallemans. They\\nlay in wait for him the next day as he came from school. Walter,\\nwho had painted to himself how they would be panting under the\\nweight of the great sack; Walter, who was so anxious to know if\\nChristian Kloskamp had taken what he had ordered; Walter, who was\\nburning with curiosity as to the success of the venture--oh, he was\\nbitterly disappointed. Gustave Halleman not only carried no sack of\\npeppermints. What's more, he had a very grave face. And little Franz\\nlooked like virtue itself.\\n\\n\\\"Well, how is everything?\\\" Walter asked, but without saying a word. He\\nwas too curious not to ask, and too fearful to express the question\\notherwise than by opening his mouth and poking out his face.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you know, Walter, we've been thinking about the matter; and\\nthere's a lot to be said against the plan.\\\"\\n\\nPoor Walter! In that moment both his heart and his conscience suffered\\nshipwreck. Away with your dreams of ethical vindication, away with\\nthe gaping money-boxes of mothers--away, lead pencil that was to\\nbore a hole in the hard heart of the tall Cecilia--gone, gone, gone,\\neverything lost.\\n\\n\\\"You see, Walter, the mint-drops might melt.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Y-e-s,\\\" sobbed Walter.\\n\\n\\\"And Christian Kloskamp, who ordered twelve--don't you know----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Y-e-s.\\\"\\n\\nI wonder if Christian was likely to melt too.\\n\\n\\\"He is leaving school, and will certainly not return after the\\nholidays.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"H-e-e i-i-s?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and for that reason, and also because there are not anything like\\nso many to the pound as we had thought. Mint-drops are heavy. We've\\ncalculated everything, Franz and I.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" added little Franz, with the seriousness of one giving\\nimportant advice in a time of great danger, \\\"the things are very\\nheavy at present. Feel this one; but you must give it back to me.\\\"\\n\\nWalter weighed the mint-drop on his finger and returned it\\nconscientiously.\\n\\nHe found it heavy. Ah, in this moment he was so depressed that he\\nwould have found everything heavy.\\n\\nFranz stuck the piece of candy into his mouth, and sucking at it\\ncontinued:\\n\\n\\\"Yes, really, very heavy. These are the English drops, you know. And\\nthen there is something else, too, isn't there, Gustave? The propriety,\\nthe respectability! Tell him, Gustave.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The respectability,\\\" cried Gustave, significantly.\\n\\n\\\"We mean the respectability of it,\\\" repeated Franz, as if he were\\nexplaining something.\\n\\nWalter looked first from one to the other, and did not seem to\\ncomprehend.\\n\\n\\\"You tell him, Gustave.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Walter, Franz will tell you,\\\" said Gustave.\\n\\n\\\"Walter, our papa is a deacon, and carries a portfolio, and there\\nwhere we live is a----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" cried Gustave, \\\"there on the Gracht, you know, lives M'neer\\nKrulewinkel. He has a villa----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With a portico,\\\" added Franz.\\n\\n\\\"It's just on account of our standing--don't you see, Walter? And\\nwhen a visitor comes our mother brings out the wine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Maderia, Maderia! And our tobacco-box is silver, and----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Franz, it isn't silver; but, Walter, it looks just like silver.\\\"\\n\\nOur poor little sinner understood all of this, but he failed to see\\nwhat bearing it might have on his own disappointed hopes. He stuttered:\\n\\\"Yes, Gustave--yes, Franz--but the peppermint----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We just wanted to tell you that we are very respectable, don't\\nyou see?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Gustave.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And well-behaved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Y-e-e-s, Franz.\\\" Poor Walter!\\n\\n\\\"And then as you said you never got any pocket-money----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Walter--and don't you know? Because our papa is so\\nrespectable--when winter comes you can see how he looks after the\\norphans.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and he rings at every door. And--and--we are afraid, that\\nyou----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That you----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The florin----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The florin! You understand?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That you didn't get it----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That you didn't get it honestly. That's it,\\\" said Franz, sticking\\nanother mint-drop into his mouth, perhaps to brace himself up.\\n\\nIt was out at last. Poor, miserable Walter.\\n\\n\\\"And on that account, Walter, we would rather not keep the money,\\nbut just divide now--equally, as we all agreed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" cried Gustave, \\\"divide equally. The work--we--you understand?\\\"\\n\\nThey divided the profits. And the Hallemans were sleek about\\nit. Twenty-four stivers; three into twenty-four goes eight times,\\ntherefore----\\n\\nWalter received eight stivers.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see,\\\" explained Gustave, \\\"we couldn't do it, because our\\npapa is a deacon.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes--and our tobacco-box, even if it isn't pure silver, it's just\\nlike silver.\\\"\\n\\nMy lack of faith in the extreme respectability of the Hallemans\\nis based upon the foregoing story; and I am inclined to think that\\nall this \\\"respectability\\\" of which Walter heard so much at home was\\nonly an excuse on his mother's part to get him out of the way. For\\nthere was a lack of room. If she had wanted to use Walter about the\\nhouse, it is questionable if she had discovered anything especially\\nrespectable about those boys.\\n\\nMany laws and most customs have their origin in a \\\"lack of room\\\"--in\\nthe intellect, in one's character, in the house or flat, in the fields,\\nin the city.\\n\\nThis applies to the preference for the right hand--a result of\\ncrowding at the table--to the institution of marriage, and to many\\nthings lying between these extremes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\n\\nWe will not try to explain further this fruitful principle of\\n\\\"limitation of space.\\\" Walter knew the fruit of it, even if he failed\\nto recognize the origin. He was not worried so much by the mere coming\\nhome as by the punishment he expected to receive as soon as that New\\nTestament should be missed. He had returned from his little excursion\\ninto the country with Glorioso, and now in Amsterdam again the memory\\nof his recent offense--or shall I say the anticipation of what was\\ncoming?--lay heavily on his mind.\\n\\nIf we could think away all the results of crime committed, there\\nwould be very little left of what we call conscience.\\n\\nBut Walter consoled himself with the thought that it wasn't a thimble\\nthis time. The testament will not be missed at once, he reflected,\\nbecause Sunday was a long way off, and no one would ask about it\\nduring the week.\\n\\nNo, it was not a thimble, or a knitting-needle, or a sugar-bowl,\\nor anything in daily use.\\n\\nWhen our hero got home, he stuck his greasy Glorioso under Leentje's\\nsewing-table--the same Leentje who had sewed up his breeches after\\nthat wonderful leap, so that his mother never found out about it. She\\nwent down to her grave in ignorance of these torn breeches.\\n\\nBut Leentje was employed to patch breeches and such things. She\\nreceived for this seven stivers a week, and every evening a slice of\\nbread and butter.\\n\\nLong after the Habakkuk period, Walter often thought of her humble\\n\\\"Good-evening, Juffrouw; good-evening, M'neer and the young Juffrouwen;\\ngood-evening, Walter,\\\" etc.\\n\\nYes, Walter's mother was called Juffrouw, on account of the\\nshoe-business. For Juffrouw is the title of women of the lower middle\\nclasses, while plain working women are called simply Vrouw. Mevrouw\\nis the title of women of the better classes. And so it is in the\\nNetherlands till to-day: The social structure is a series of classes,\\ngraduated in an ascending scale. Single ladies are also called\\nJuffrouw, so that Juffrouw may mean either a young lady or a young\\nmatron--who need not necessarily be so young. The young Juffrouwen\\nwere Walter's sisters, who had learned how to dance. His brother\\nhad been called M'neer since his appointment as assistant at the\\n\\\"intermediate school,\\\" a sort of charity school now no longer in\\nexistence. His mother had spliced his jacket that he might command\\nthe respect of the boys, and remarked that the name \\\"Stoffel\\\" scarcely\\nsuited him now. This explains why Leentje addressed him as M'neer. To\\nWalter she simply said Walter, for he was only a small boy. Walter\\nowed her three stivers, or, to be exact, twenty-six doits, which he\\nnever did pay her. For, years afterward, when he wanted to return the\\nmoney to her, there were no more doits; and, besides, Leentje was dead.\\n\\nThis pained him very much, for he had thought a great deal of her. She\\nwas ugly, even dirty, and was stoop-shouldered, too. Stoffel, the\\nschoolmaster, said that she had an evil tongue: She was thought to\\nhave started the report that he had once eaten strawberries with\\nsugar in the \\\"Netherlands.\\\" This was a small garden-restaurant.\\n\\nI am willing to admit the truth of all this; but what more could one\\nexpect for seven stivers and a slice of bread and butter? I have known\\nduchesses who had larger incomes; and still in social intercourse\\nthey were not agreeable.\\n\\nLeentje was stooped as a result of continuous sewing. Her needle\\nkept the whole family clothed; and she knew how to make two jackets\\nand a cap out of an old coat and still have enough pieces left for\\nthe gaiters that Stoffel needed for his final examination. He fell\\nthrough on account of a mistake in Euclid.\\n\\nWith the exception of Walter nobody was satisfied with Leentje. I\\nbelieve they were afraid of spoiling her by too much kindness. Walter's\\nsisters were always talking about \\\"class\\\" and \\\"rank,\\\" saying that\\n\\\"everyone must stay in his place.\\\" This was for Leentje. Her father\\nhad been a cobbler who soled shoes, while the father of the young\\nJuffrouwen had had a store in which \\\"shoes from Paris\\\" were sold. A\\nbig difference. For it is much grander to sell something that somebody\\nelse has made than to make something one's self.\\n\\nThe mother thought that Leentje might be a little cleaner. But I am\\ngoing to speak of the price again, and of the difficulty of washing\\nwhen one has no time, no soap, no room, and no water. At that time\\nwaterpipes had not been laid, and, if they had been, it's a question\\nif the water had ever got as far as Leentje.\\n\\nSo, everyone but Walter had a spite against Leentje. He liked her,\\nand was more intimate with her than with anyone else in the house,\\nperhaps because the others could not endure him, and there was nothing\\nleft for him to do but to seek consolation from her. For every feeling\\nfinds expression, and nothing is lost, either in the moral or in the\\nmaterial world. I could say more about this, but I prefer to drop the\\nsubject now, for the organ-grinder under my window is driving me crazy.\\n\\nWalter's mother called him, \\\"That boy.\\\" His brothers--there were\\nmore beside Stoffel--affirmed that he was treacherous and morose,\\nbecause he spoke little and didn't care for \\\"marbles.\\\" When he did say\\nanything, they attributed to him a relationship with King Solomon's\\ncat. His sisters declared he was a little devil. But Walter stood\\nwell with Leentje. She consoled him, and considered it disgraceful\\nthat the family didn't make more out of such a boy as Walter. She\\nhad seen that he was not a child like ordinary children. And I should\\nscarcely take the trouble to write his story if he had been.\\n\\nUp to a short time after his trip to Hartenstraat, Ash Gate and the\\nold bridge, Leentje was Walter's sole confidant. To her he read\\nthe verses that slender Cecilia had disdained. To her he poured\\nout his grief over the injustice of his teacher Pennewip, who gave\\nhim only \\\"Fair,\\\" while to that red-headed Keesje he gave \\\"Very good\\\"\\nunderscored--Keesje who couldn't work an example by himself and always\\n\\\"stuck\\\" in \\\"Holland Counts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor boy,\\\" said Leentje, \\\"you're right about it.\\\" They went over into\\nthe Bavarian house. It's a disgrace! And to save a doit on the pound.\\n\\nShe claimed that Keesje's father, who was a butcher, let Pennewip\\nhave meat at a reduced price, and that this was what was the matter\\nwith all those Holland counts and their several houses.\\n\\nLater Walter looked upon this as a \\\"white lie,\\\" for Pennewip, when\\nexamined closely, didn't look like a man who would carry on a crooked\\nbusiness with beefsteak. But in those days he accepted gladly this\\nfrivolous suspicion against the man's honor as a plaster for his own,\\nwhich had been hurt by the favoritism towards Keesje. Whenever our\\nhonor is touched, or what we regard as our honor, then we think little\\nof the honor of others.\\n\\nWhen his brothers jeered at him and called him \\\"Professor Walter,\\\"\\nor when his sisters scolded him for his \\\"idiotic groping among\\nthe bed-curtains,\\\" or when his mother punished him for eating up\\nthe rice that she intended to serve again \\\"to-morrow\\\"--then it was\\nalways Leentje who restored the equilibrium of his soul and banished\\nhis cares, just as, with her inimitable stitches, she banished the\\n\\\"triangles\\\" from his jacket and breeches.\\n\\nUgly, dirty, evil-tongued Leentje, how Walter did like you! What\\nconsolation radiated from her thimble, what encouragement even in\\nthe sight of her tapeline! And what a lullaby in those gentle words:\\n\\\"There now, you have a needle and thread and scraps. Sew your little\\nsack for your pencils and tell me more of all those counts, who always\\npassed over from one house into another.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\n\\nI don't know what prophet Walter got as punishment for that pawned\\nBible. The pastor came to preach a special sermon. The man was simply\\nhorrified at such impiousness. Juffrouw Laps, who lived in the lower\\nanteroom, had heard about it too. She was very pious and asserted\\nthat such a boy was destined for the gallows.\\n\\n\\\"One begins with the Bible,\\\" she said significantly, \\\"and ends with\\nsomething else.\\\"\\n\\nNo one has ever found out just what that \\\"something else\\\" is which\\nfollows a beginning with the Bible. I don't think she knew herself,\\nand that she said it to make people believe that she possessed much\\nwisdom and knew more about the world than she gave utterance to. Now,\\nI admit that I have no respect for wisdom that cannot express itself\\nin intelligible words, and, if it had been my affair, I should have\\nvery promptly drawn a tight rein on Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\nStoffel delivered an exhortation in which he brought out all that had\\nbeen forgotten by the preacher. He spoke of Korah, Dathan and Abiram,\\nwho had erred similarly to Walter and had been sent to an early grave\\nfor their sins. He said too, that the honor of the family had been\\nlost at the \\\"Ouwebrug,\\\" that it was his duty, \\\"as the eldest son of an\\nirreproachable widow and third assistant at the intermediate school,\\nto take care of the honor of the house----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of Bavaria,\\\" said Leentje softly.\\n\\nThat \\\"a marriage, or any other arrangement for the girls, would be\\nfrustrated by Walter's offence, for no one would have anything to do\\nwith girls who----\\\"\\n\\nIn short, Stoffel accented the fact that it was \\\"a disgrace,\\\" and that\\n\\\"he would never be able to look anyone in the face who knew of this\\ncrime.\\\" He remarked distinctly that the schoolboys must know of it,\\nfor Louis Hopper had already stuck out his tongue at him!\\n\\nAnd finally, that he \\\"shuddered to cross the new market-place\\\"--in\\nthose days criminals were scourged, branded and hanged here--because\\nit reminded him so disagreeably of Juffrouw Laps's horrible allusion\\nto Walter's fate.\\n\\nThen followed all sorts of things about Korahs, Dathans and Abirams,\\nwhereupon the whole family broke out in a wail. For it was so pathetic.\\n\\nWalter comforted himself with thoughts of Glorioso, and, whenever that\\n\\\"something else\\\" of Juffrouw Laps was spoken of, he just dreamed of\\nhis marriage with beautiful Amalia, whose train was carried by six\\npages. I fancy Juffrouw Laps would have made a pretty face if she\\nhad learned of this interpretation of her mysterious climax.\\n\\nAll efforts to compel our hero to tell how he had spent that money were\\nin vain. After all known means had been applied, the attempt to force a\\nconfession had to be abandoned. Water and bread, water without bread,\\nbread without water, no water and no bread, the preacher, Stoffel,\\nHabakkuk, Juffrouw Laps, tears, the rod--all in vain. Walter was not\\nthe boy to betray Glorioso. This was what he had found so shabby of\\nScelerajoso, who had to pay the penalty, as we have seen.\\n\\nAs soon as he got the privilege of walking again with the Hallemans,\\nwho were so eminently respectable, he hurried away to the old bridge,\\nnear Ash Gate, to continue his thrilling book. He read up to that\\nfatal moment when he had to tell his hero good-bye, and on the last\\npage saw Glorioso, as a major-general, peacefully expire in the arms\\nof the virtuous Alvira.\\n\\nWhen Walter had returned the book to Hartenstraat his eye was attracted\\nby some almond-cakes at the confectioner's on the corner. He did with\\nGlorioso just as the Athenians did with Kodrus: No one was worthy to\\nbe the successor of such a hero, and within a few days the residue\\nof the New Testament had been converted into stomach-destroying pastry.\\n\\nI ought to add that a part of the \\\"balance\\\" left after that Italian\\nexcursion--perhaps the part contributed by the Psalms--was invested\\nin a triple-toned, ear-splitting, soul-searing harmonica, which was\\nfinally confiscated by Master Pennewip as being a disturbing element\\nin the schoolroom.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\n\\nI don't feel called upon to pass judgment on the strife between\\nLeentje and Pennewip regarding the latter's partiality towards Keesje,\\nthe butcher's son. But that fiery feeling for right and justice\\nwhich has harrassed me from my earliest youth--ah, for years have I\\nwaited in vain for justice--and the foolish passion for hunting after\\nmitigating circumstances, even when the misdeed has been proved--all\\nthis compels me to say that Pennewip's lot might be considered a\\nmitigating circumstance for a man convicted of the eight deadly sins.\\n\\nI have found that many great men began their careers as feeders of\\nhogs (see biographical encyclopedias); and it seems to me that this\\noccupation develops those qualities necessary in ruling or advancing\\nmankind.\\n\\nIf the theologists should happen to criticise this story, and perhaps\\naccuse me of far-reaching ignorance, because I enumerate one cardinal\\nsin more than they knew of, or of the crime of classifying man as\\na sort of hog, I reply that, still another new canonical sin could\\nbe discovered that they have never studied. And that ought to be as\\npleasing to them as influenza is to the apothecary.\\n\\nNew problems, gentlemen, new problems!\\n\\nAnd as for our relationship with pigs, just consider the relation\\nof coal to diamond, and I think everyone will be satisfied--even\\nthe theologists.\\n\\nWhat a magnificent prospect anyone has who spends his tender youth\\nwith those grunting coal-diamonds of the animal world! But I have\\noften wondered that in the \\\"Lives of Famous Men\\\" we so seldom read of\\na school-teacher, for in the school all the ingredients of greatness\\nare abounding.\\n\\nThe reverse is more often true. Every day we see banished princes\\nteaching lazy boys. Dionysius and Louis Philippe are not the only\\nones. I myself once tried to teach an American French. It was no go.\\n\\nIf it should ever become customary again to elect kings, I hope the\\npeople will elect such persons as have studied men, just as one studies\\nGeography on globes or maps. All virtues, propensities, passions,\\nmistakes, misdeeds, knowledge of which is so indispensable in human\\nsociety, can be studied much better in the schoolroom. The field is\\nrestricted, and can be taken in more readily. The famous statecraft\\nof many a great man, if the truth were known, had its origin in that\\nold tripping trick, which is everything to the three-foot Machiavellis.\\n\\nThe task of a schoolmaster is not an easy one. I have never understood\\nwhy he is not better paid, or, since this must be so, why there are\\nstill men who prefer to teach, when on the same pay they might be\\ncorporals in the army, and teach the use of firearms, which offers\\nfewer headaches and more fresh air.\\n\\nI would even rather be a preacher; for he does work with people who are\\ninterested and come to hear him of their own free will. The teacher\\nhas to fight continually with indifference, and with the extremely\\ndangerous rivalry of tops, marbles, and paper-dolls--not to speak of\\ncandy, scarlatina and weak mothers.\\n\\nPennewip was a man of the old school. At least he would seem so to\\nus if we could see him in his gray school jacket and short trousers\\nwith buckles, and his brown wig, which he was continually pushing\\ninto place. At the first of the week this was always curly, when it\\nwas not raining--rain isn't good for curls; and on Sundays \\\"the man\\nwith the curling irons\\\" came.\\n\\nAntiquated? But perhaps this is only imagination. Who knows? perhaps\\nin his day he was quite modern. How soon people will say the same\\nof us! At all events, the man called himself \\\"Master\\\" and his school\\nwas a school and not an \\\"Institute.\\\" It is no advance to call things\\nby other than their right names. In his school boys and girls sat\\ntogether indiscriminately, according to the na\\u00efve custom of those\\ndays. They learned, or might learn, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic,\\nNational History, Psalmody, Sewing, Knitting, and Religion. These\\nwere the order of the day, but if anyone distinguished himself by\\na show of talent, diligence or good behavior, that one received\\nspecial instruction in versification, an art in which Pennewip took\\ngreat pleasure.\\n\\nThus he taught the boys till they were sufficiently advanced to be\\nconfirmed. With the help of his wife he gave the girls a \\\"finishing\\ncourse.\\\" They were graduated with a paternoster done in red on a black\\nbackground, or perhaps a pierced heart between two flower-pots. Then\\nthey were through and ready to become the grandmothers of their\\nown generation.\\n\\nThere was no natural science then. Even to-day there is room for\\nimprovement along this line. It is said that some advance has been\\nmade recently. It is more useful for a child to know how corn grows\\nthan to be able to call the name of it in a foreign language. I don't\\nsay that either is incompatible with the other.\\n\\nThe public schools were most deficient at the time when Walter and\\nKeesje were slowly crawling around the arena of honor; but I doubt if\\none could say much more of the \\\"institutes\\\" of to-day. I would advise\\neveryone to visit such a school as he attended when a boy; and I am\\nconvinced that after this test many a father who has the welfare of\\nhis children at heart will prefer to keep them at home. One comes to\\nthe conclusion, that after all in the school of clever Master Miller,\\nwho was so clever that he got himself addressed as M'sieu Millaire,\\nprecious little was to be learned.\\n\\nFailing to make this test we continue to believe in the infallibility\\nof M'sieu of Millaire. We always consider that one a great man whom\\nwe have known in childhood and haven't seen since.\\n\\nWhen I remarked a moment ago that school-teachers are paid so\\nniggardly, I didn't mean that their remuneration was insufficient,\\nconsidering the quality and quantity of the goods delivered--knowledge,\\nscholarship, education. I only had in mind the bitterness of their\\nlot, and the poor indemnity given to the man who spends his life in\\na wasp's nest.\\n\\nIn addition to versifying, Pennewip had still another hobby, which gave\\nhim more claim to a throne than did anything else. He was possessed\\nwith the mania for classifying, a passion known to few, but still of\\nnot infrequent occurrence. I have never quite understood the disease;\\nand I gave up my search for the \\\"first cause\\\" as soon as I saw how\\ndifficult it is to get around with a hobby-horse taken from somebody\\nelse's stable. So I am going to give only a short sketch of Pennewip's\\nharmless animal.\\n\\nEverything that he saw, perceived, experienced he divided into\\nfamilies, classes, genera, species and sub-species, and made of the\\nhuman race a sort of botanical garden, in which he was the Linne. He\\nregarded that as the only possible way to grasp the final purpose\\nof creation and clear up all obscure things, both in and out of\\nschool. He even went so far as to say that Walter's New Testament\\nwould have turned up again if Juffrouw Pieterse had only been able\\nto tell to what class the man belonged who had bound the volume in\\nblack leather. But that was something she didn't know.\\n\\nAs for myself, I shouldn't have said a word about Pennewip's mania for\\nclassifying everything, if I hadn't thought it might help me to give\\nthe reader a better picture of our hero and his surroundings. I should\\nhave preferred to leave the said Pennewip in undisturbed intercourse\\nwith the muses; but we shall have occasion later to refer to his\\npoetic art, when we shall quote some poems by his pupils.\\n\\nAfter the usual general division into \\\"animate\\\" and \\\"inanimate\\\"--the\\ngood man gave the human race only one soul--followed a system that\\nlooked like a pyramid. On the top was God with the angels and\\nspirits and other accessories, while the oysters and polyps and\\nmussels were crawling about down near the base, or lying still--just\\nas they pleased. Half way up stood kings, members of school-boards,\\nmayors, legislators, theologians and D.D.'s. Next under these were\\nprofessors and merchants who do not work themselves. Then came\\ndoctors of things profane, i. e., those driving double rigs, also\\nlawyers and untitled preachers, the Colonel of the City Militia,\\nthe Rector of the Latin School. Philosophers (only those who have\\ndeveloped a system), doctors with one horse, doctors without any\\nhorse and poets were further down. Rather low down, and not far from\\nthe mussels, was the seventh sub-division of the third class of the\\n\\\"citizen population.\\\" Our hero would come under this sub-section.\\n\\n\\n    Citizen Population, Class III., 7th Sub-Division.\\n\\n    People Living in Rented Flats.\\n\\n    a.

No maid, or person for rough work, but a seamstress\\n    on seven stivers and a piece of bread and butter.\\n\\n\\nThat brings us to Juffrouw Pieterse.\\n\\nThe reader will now have a very good idea of Walter's environment, and\\nwill readily understand why I said he had a \\\"city complexion.\\\" That\\nwas when we saw him in the Hartenstraat, on the road to fame, or on\\nthe road to that nameless \\\"other thing\\\" of Juffrouw Laps. At all\\nevents he was on his way to things that will occupy our attention\\nfor some time yet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n\\nIt was Wednesday, and the Pieterses were going to give a\\nparty. Juffrouw Laps had been invited, also the Juffrouw living\\nover the dairy, whose husband was employed at the \\\"bourse.\\\" Further\\nMrs. Stotter, who had been a midwife for so long and was still merely\\n\\\"very respectable.\\\" Then the widow Zipperman, whose daughter had\\nmarried some fellow in the insurance business, or something of the\\nkind. Also the baker's wife. That was unavoidable: it was impossible\\nto buy all kinds of pastry and cakes without her finding out what\\nwas up. Then the Juffrouw living below and to the rear. Of course\\nshe wouldn't come, but the Pieterses wanted to show that they had\\nforgotten the late quarrel over the broken window-pane. If she didn't\\ncome that was the end of the matter, so far as Juffrouw Pieterse was\\nconcerned. She would have nothing more to do with the Juffrouw from\\nbelow. I may add that the lady from below did not come, and that her\\nname was stricken from the calling-list of those higher up.\\n\\nThe children were to go to bed early, with the promise of a cup of\\nsage-milk for breakfast if they would not make any noise the entire\\nevening. This drink largely took the place of tea then. It was thought\\nthat the \\\"noise\\\" made by children would not be appreciated. Walter\\ngot permission to go play with the Halleman boys, who were thought\\nto be very respectable. He must be at home by eight o'clock; but this\\nwas said in a tone that gave him no cause to fear a reprimand in case\\nhe should stay out later. Laurens, who of course was an apprentice to\\na printer, and usually came home about seven o'clock in the evening,\\nwas big enough to be present with the guests, but must promise to sit\\nstill and drink only two glasses. The big girls were to be present\\nas a matter of course: They had been confirmed. Stoffel presided. His\\nbusiness was to meet the gentlemen when they came for the ladies about\\nten o'clock, and entertain the company with stories of Mungo Park.\\n\\nLeentje was to remain till the people were all there, as it was so\\ninconvenient to have to open the door every time. She could make\\nherself useful in arranging the table and doing other things incident\\nto such occasions. But she \\\"must move about a little brisker,\\\"\\notherwise they would prefer to do everything themselves.\\n\\nThe eldest of the girls, Juffrouw Truitje, must look after the\\n\\\"sage-milk.\\\" Pietje had charge of the sandwiches; but Myntje was to\\nsee to it that the butter was spread a little thicker, for the last\\ntime the bread had been too dry.\\n\\nEverything was going to turn out so nicely, \\\"if only Juffrouw\\nLaps wouldn't talk so much.\\\" That was her failing. And, too, they\\nhoped that the widow Zipperman would \\\"brag a little less about her\\nson-in-law.\\\" This was considered a source of weariness. And the\\nJuffrouw who lived over the dairy \\\"might be more modest.\\\" She had\\n\\\"never lived in such a fine house\\\"; and as for the shop--that was no\\ndisgrace; and on the top floor--but one cannot tell how it will be.\\n\\nNo one understood why the baker's wife used so many French words, which\\nwas not becoming in one of her station. \\\"If she does it this evening,\\nStoffel, say something to me that she can't understand, then she will\\nfind out that we are not 'from the street,' that we know what's what.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's all the same to me,\\\" Juffrouw Pieterse continued, \\\"whether the\\nJuffrouw downstairs comes or not. I don't care a fig about it.--Four,\\nfive--Louw can sit there, but he must keep his legs still--and a chair\\nthere--yes--so! It's a good thing she's not coming; it would have been\\ntoo crowded. Leentje, go to work--do blow your nose! No, run over to\\nJuffrouw Laps's and ask the Juffrouw if the Juffrouw could spare a\\nfew stools--without backs, you understand; because the chairs there\\nby the chimney--yes, ask the Juffrouw for a few stools, and tell the\\nJuffrouw that they are for me, and that I expect the Juffrouws about\\nseven. Give my compliments to the Juffrouw and wipe your nose.\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse didn't like to use personal pronouns; it was\\nimpolite.\\n\\nOn this afternoon Walter went to his bridge early. It was now not\\nso useless as usual, for the rain of the day before had filled the\\nditch with water, which was even running, so that the straws which\\nWalter thoughtlessly, or full of thought--both are about the same\\nthing--threw into the water were carried down to the pond, where\\nthe logs lay that were to be sawed up by the \\\"Eagle\\\" and the \\\"Early\\nHour.\\\" These were the names of the sawmills that for some weeks had\\nbeen the witnesses of Walter's daydreams.\\n\\nGlorioso was gone, and could not be replaced; but on those afternoons\\nwhen he was free Walter returned involuntarily to the spot where he had\\nhad his first glimpse of the world of romance. How rough and crude the\\ncolors in that first picture! Perhaps it was the very roughness of the\\ncolors that attracted him and changed him, till he could not conceive\\nhow he had ever found enjoyment in the little cakes on the corner.\\n\\nA peculiar prospective had opened up before him. He dreamed of things\\nthat he could not name; but they made him bitterly dissatisfied with\\nhis present condition. He was anxious to do everything prescribed\\nto get to Heaven; but he thought it would be much easier to pray in\\nsuch a cave with wax candles. And as for honoring his mother, a point\\nupon which she always laid great stress--why didn't she have a train\\nlike the countess? Certainly he ought not to have sold the Bible;\\nand he wouldn't do it any more--he had vowed it; but then he ought\\nto have had a box filled with florins, and a feather in his cap,\\njust as it was in the book.\\n\\nHe was disgusted with his brother Stoffel, and his sisters, and\\nJuffrouw Laps, and the preacher and everything. He couldn't understand\\nwhy the whole family didn't go to Italy and form a respectable\\nrobber-band. But Pennewip and Keesje shouldn't go; that was certain.\\n\\nHe wondered what had become of his verses. Every Wednesday such\\npupils as had been well-behaved, and, for that reason, deemed worthy\\nto contest for the \\\"laurel,\\\" handed in a poem written on some subject\\nsuggested by the teacher. This time the subject assigned to Walter was\\n\\\"Goodness,\\\" which probably had some reference to his former behavior,\\nand was a hint for the improvement of his moral character. But Walter\\nhad already put goodness into rhyme so often, and found the subject so\\ndry and tedious and worn-out that he had taken the liberty of \\\"singing\\\"\\nsomething else. He selected the theme nearest his heart--robbers!\\n\\nLike all authors he was greatly infatuated with his work. He was\\nconvinced that the teacher, too, would see the excellencies of his poem\\nand forgive him for deviating from the path of goodness. The verses\\nwould undoubtedly be sent to the mayor, and he would pass them on to\\nthe Pope, who would then summon Walter and appoint him \\\"Court-robber.\\\"\\n\\nAnd thus he dreamed and threw his straws into the stream. They\\nmoved away slowly and disappeared between the moss-covered\\ntimbers. Involuntarily his fancy had transmuted them into the\\ncharacters of his world of romance. There went the countess with\\nher long train, which got caught in the moss and held the countess\\nfast. The virtuous Amalia met with no better luck; she got tangled\\nup in the water lentils. And now came Walter himself. He approached\\nAmalia, in her green robes, and was just about to rescue her, when\\nhe was swallowed by a duck. This was most unkind of the duck, for\\nit was Walter's last stalk of grass; and now in the rattling and\\nbuzzing of the sawmills below he could hear Amalia repeating in a\\nreproachful voice:\\n\\n\\n            \\\"Warre, warre, warre, we;\\n            Where is warre, warre, wall--\\n            Walter, who will rescue me?\\\"\\n\\n\\nThis annoyed him, and he could not resist the temptation to throw\\na rock at the duck whose greediness had caused Amalia to doubt his\\nchivalry.\\n\\nThe duck chose the better part, and retired after she had done Walter\\nall the damage she could. But the sawmills paid no attention to these\\nhappenings and continued to rattle away.\\n\\nWalter heard now in the noisy clatter of the mills all kinds of songs\\nand stories, and, listening to these, he soon forgot Amalia and the\\nPope. That the reader may not get a wrong impression of these mills,\\nI hasten to say that there was really nothing extraordinary about\\nthem. They buzzed and rattled just like other sawmills.\\n\\nIt often happens that we think we perceive something which comes from\\nthe external world, when in fact it is only a subjective product in\\nourselves. Similarly, we may think we have just imagined something,\\nwhen really it came to us from the world of the senses.\\n\\nThis is a kind of ventriloquism that often gives cause for annoyance\\nand enmity.\\n\\nI wonder which turns the faster?--Walter listened to the mills. Now--I\\nthink--no, begin together. Good! No, the Eagle was ahead! Once\\nmore--now!\\n\\nWhich will get there first? No, that won't do. Once more together. Look\\nsharp, Morning Hour,--out again! I can't hold my eye on it--what a\\nwhirling and buzzing!\\n\\nYou are tired, are you? I believe it.\\n\\nIf I might only sit on such a big wing, wouldn't I hold on tight? And\\nwouldn't the sawyer look?\\n\\nWhy are you called \\\"Morning Hour\\\"? Have you gold in your mouth? And\\n\\\"Eagle\\\"! Can you fly? Take me with you. What a big play-ground up\\nthere, and no school!\\n\\nI wonder how the first school began. Which came first, the school,\\nor the teacher? But the first teacher must have attended a school. And\\nthe first school must have had a teacher.\\n\\nSo the first school must have just started itself. But that is\\nimpossible. \\\"Eagle,\\\" can you turn yourself?--with the wind? Can you\\nturn yourself some other way? Try it. Beat \\\"Morning Hour.\\\" Quick,\\nquick--beautiful!\\n\\nNow, once more alone. Good!\\n\\nNow, together again! Karre, karre, kra, kra--stretch your arms out and\\ntake me with you. Will you? Put your hat on, Eagle; how the ribbons\\nfly.--Who are you? Warre, warre, ware, wan--I can't help it; it was the\\nduck. Tell me what your name is. Fanny, fanny, fanny, fan---- Is your\\nname fan? And you, Morning Hour, what is your name? Ceny, ceny, ceny,\\nce. What kind of a name is Ce? Now together--sing a song together:\\n\\n\\n            Fanny, fanny, fanny, fan--\\n            Ceny, ceny, ceny, ce--\\n            Fanny, ceny, fanny, ceny,\\n            Fanny, ceny, fan--cy.\\n\\n\\nFancy--what do you mean by that? Is that the name of both of you? And\\nwhat is it? Has it wings?\\n\\n\\\"Morning Hour\\\" and \\\"Eagle\\\" had fused into something that had wings\\nand was called fancy.\\n\\nFancy lifted Walter up and bore him away.\\n\\nWhen she brought him back to the bridge again it had already been\\ndark for a long time. He shook himself as if he were wet, rubbed his\\neyes and started home. We shall see later what awaited him there;\\nbut first we must go back a few hours. I hope the reader will not\\ndisdain an invitation to Juffrouw Pieterse's. Remember that her\\nhusband never made anything, but bought everything ready-made in Paris.\\n\\nIn passing by I should like to make Master Pennewip a short visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n\\nSchool was out; and the seats looked as if the pupils had just left\\nthe tediousness of it all lying there. The map of Europe looked down\\npeevishly on the heap of writing-pads. There lay the mutilated and\\nwell-worn goose-quills, which since time immemorial have opened up\\nthe gates of learning. True, the black-board vaunted itself with the\\nheavy results of the last lesson in \\\"fractions\\\"; but the school was\\nno more. The spirit had fled: It was a corpse.\\n\\nYes, the \\\"Geist\\\" had gone out with the children; for the reader will\\nsee in a moment that they carried about with them a tremendous amount\\nof that article.\\n\\nWe already know that this was the great day when Pennewip was to\\ncriticise the poetical effusions of his young geniuses. There he sat,\\nhis restless wig sharing all the poetical feelings and emotions--and\\nmotions--of its owner. We will just look over his shoulder and read\\nwith him those inestimable treasures of poetic art; and perhaps we\\ntoo shall be moved to emotion.\\n\\nWig: In the middle, resting quietly.\\n\\n\\n    Lucas de Bryer: \\\"Our Native Land.\\\"\\n\\n    Cake and wine and native land,\\n    Out in the moonlight I take my stand;\\n    Our native land and cake and wine,\\n    And I hope the moon will shine;\\n    Five fingers have I on my hand,\\n    All to honor our native land.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Melodious,\\\" said the teacher, \\\"very melodious; and very profound. Cake\\nand wine, with our native land as a climax.\\\"\\n\\nWig: On the right side.\\n\\n\\n    Lizzie Webbelar: \\\"My Father's Vocation.\\\"\\n\\n    The cat is sly, I know;\\n    My father is a dealer in Po-\\n    Tatoes and onions.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Original, immediate! But I don't like the way she cuts her potatoes\\nin twain.\\\"\\n\\nWig: On the left side.\\n\\n\\n    Jeanette Rust: \\\"The Weather-cock.\\\"\\n\\n    He stands on the chimney since long ago,\\n    And shows the wind which way to blow.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Smooth, but not quite correct, if examined closely--but I'll let it\\npass as poetic license.\\\"\\n\\nWig: Down in front.\\n\\n\\n    Leendert Snelleman: \\\"Lent.\\\"\\n\\n    In Lent it is always nice,\\n    My brother's birth-day is in May,\\n    He says his feet need warming,\\n    So that Lent we must be praising,\\n    And then we're going to celebrate,\\n    Easter brings eggs and a holiday.\\n\\n\\n\\\"It's too bad that he's so careless with his rhymes. His imagination\\nis extraordinary. Very original.\\\"\\n\\nWig: Down on his neck.\\n\\n\\n    Keesje, the Butcher's Boy: \\\"In Praise of the Teacher.\\\"\\n\\n    My father has slaughtered many a steer,\\n    But Master Pennewip is still living, I hear;\\n    Some are lean, and some are well-fed,\\n    He has slipped his wig to the side of his head.\\n\\n\\nThe wig actually went to the side of his head.\\n\\n\\\"Well, this is curious. I hardly know what to say about it.\\\"\\n\\nThe wig slipped to the other side.\\n\\n\\\"What's the connection between me and steers?\\\"\\n\\nThe wig protested vigorously against any implication of relationship\\nwith steers.\\n\\n\\\"H--mm! Can it be that this is what our new-fangled writers call\\nhumour?\\\"\\n\\nThe wig sank down to his eyebrows, which signified doubt.\\n\\n\\\"I will call up the boy and----\\\"\\n\\nThe wig passed again to the zenith, to express its satisfaction with\\nthe teacher's determination to interview the butcher's boy.\\n\\n\\n    Lucas de Wilde: \\\"Religion.\\\"\\n\\n    Religion very nice must be,\\n    Much it pleases the people we see.\\n\\n\\n\\\"The fundamental idea is very beautiful,\\\" said the teacher, \\\"but it\\nought to have been developed better.\\\"\\n\\nThe wig nodded acquiescence.\\n\\n\\n    Trudie Gier: \\\"Juffrouw Pennewip.\\\"\\n\\n    The path of virtue she shows us each day,\\n    And we are glad to go that way;\\n    And as there's nothing to do more fitting,\\n    She teaches us sewing, darning and knitting.\\n\\n\\nThe wig fairly leaped with pleasure, and the curls embraced one\\nanother. This out-pouring of Trudie's heart was borne at once to\\nJuffrouw Pennewip, and was later hung by the fireplace in honor of\\nthe poetess and the subject of the poem.\\n\\nThen followed a sublime poem on God by Klaasje van der Gracht, the\\nson of the Catechist. He was thirteen years old, and had not been\\nvaccinated--out of regard for predestination.\\n\\n\\\"If only his father didn't help him!\\\"\\n\\nThe wig was rigid with astonishment.\\n\\n\\n    Louwtje de Wilde: \\\"Friendship.\\\"\\n\\n    Friendship very nice must be,\\n    Much it pleases the people we see.\\n\\n\\nThe wig seemed dissatisfied. The \\\"Religion\\\" of Lucas de Wilde was\\npulled out and compared with Louwtje's \\\"Friendship.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"H--emm. It is possible. Another example of how one thought can\\noriginate in two heads at the same time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n    Wimpje de Wilde: \\\"Fishing.\\\"\\n\\n    Fishing very----\\n\\n\\n\\\"What's that?\\\"\\n\\nYes, really, there it was again:\\n\\n\\n    Fishing very nice must be,\\n    Much it pleases the people we see.\\n\\n\\nThe wig was moving continually. It looked as if it were fishing too.\\n\\nThe teacher looked hurriedly through the remaining poems and picked out\\nthe offspring of the entire Wilde connection. His worst suspicions were\\nrealized. Mietje de Wilde, Kees de Wilde, Piet and Jan de Wilde--all\\nuniformly declared that religion, friendship, fishing, dreaming,\\ncauliflower and deception \\\"very nice must be,\\\" and that they were\\nalso very pleasing \\\"to the people we see.\\\" A regular flood of the\\nnice and pleasing.\\n\\nNow, what do you suppose the wig did? It did the best thing that\\ncould be done under the circumstances. More could not be expected of a\\nwig. As soon as it saw the futility of its efforts to comprehend the\\ndifference between fishing, friendship, deception, dreams, religion\\nand cauliflower, it merely ignored the whole matter, readjusted itself\\nand assumed an expression of expectancy for what was yet to come.\\n\\n\\n    Leentje de Haas: \\\"Admiral de Ruyter.\\\"\\n\\n    Pulling the rope with emotion,\\n      To the top of the mast he came,\\n    And then he went to the ocean,\\n      And won for himself great fame.\\n\\n    And very much more he perfected,\\n      Saleh he vanquished, too;\\n    A hero he was then elected,\\n      With nothing else to do.\\n\\n\\nThe wig lifted itself, the curls applauding enthusiastically. It was\\nevidently pleased.\\n\\n\\n    Grete Wauzer: \\\"The Caterpillar.\\\"\\n\\n    The caterpillar, free from care,\\n    Crawls on the tree just over there.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Descriptive poetry. A daring idea--the caterpillar crawling on the\\ntree free from care.\\\"\\n\\nWig: Quiet.\\n\\nAh, the pleasure of a wig is short-lived! And how soon was this\\none--but I will not anticipate. Soon, all too soon, the reader will\\nknow the worst.\\n\\n\\n    Walter Pieterse: \\\"A Robber Song.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Aha, what's this? And 'goodness'? But where has he written on\\ngoodness?\\\"\\n\\nThe teacher could scarcely believe his eyes. He turned the sheet of\\npaper over and examined the back side, hoping to discover there some\\nlines on goodness.\\n\\nThen he saw that on Walter's sheet there was not a trace of \\\"goodness.\\\"\\n\\nOh, wretched wig!\\n\\nYes, wretched wig! For after it had suffered as never wig had\\nsuffered before, after it had been pulled at and tugged at\\nand martyred in a manner beyond even the imagination of the\\nWilde family, Master Pennewip snatched it from his head,\\ntwisted it convulsively in his hands, stammered a short\\n\\\"Heaven-human-Christian-soul-good-gracious-my-life--how is it\\npossible!\\\" slapped it on his head again, covered it with his venerable\\ncap and burst out the door like one possessed.\\n\\nHe was on his way to Walter's home, where we shall soon see him\\narrive. As a conscientious historian, however, it will be my duty\\nfirst to give an account of the happenings there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\n\\n\\\"Goodness, I'm glad to see you! And so early, too! Leetje, place a\\nchair over there and get the footstool, but be in a hurry, or I'd\\nrather do it myself. And how are you? Juffrouw Laps is coming too,\\nyou know--Myntje, you'd better be thinking of your dough and stop\\ncombing your head. That girl can't keep her hands off of her hair\\nwhen there's company. But do take a seat--no, not in the corner;\\nthere's a draft there.\\\"\\n\\nThere was no more draft in this corner than is usual to corners;\\nbut Mrs. Stotter was only a Vrouw, and not a \\\"Juffrouw.\\\" She had\\nno right to the seat of honour; for on all occasions a Juffrouw\\ntakes precedence of a Vrouw, just as a Mevrouw takes precedence of\\na Juffrouw. Everyone must keep his place, especially those in III,\\n7, b1; or c., where etiquette is observed more closely than at the\\ncourt of Madrid. The care and anxiety of the mistress of ceremonies\\nmake her work most trying, and, too, not merely for Juffrouw Pieterse.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my dear Juffrouw Pieterse, I was so surprised when Louwie came\\nto invite me, for I had just remarked to Wimpje, who makes caps, you\\nknow--no, thank you, Pietje, I don't care for any just now--I said\\nto Wimpje, I wonder what Juffrouw Pieterse is doing, for I hadn't\\nheard from you in so long, you know--yes, just throw it aside, it's\\nmy old one; I knew you wouldn't mind my wearing my old one--and then\\nWimpje said----\\\"\\n\\nWhat Wimpje really said I don't know. Mrs. Stotter's garment, which she\\nhad described as her \\\"old one,\\\" was removed and placed on the foot of\\nthe bed in the back room. The children, who were piled together there\\nlike sardines, were duly admonished not to stretch out their feet,\\nlest in doing so they injure Mrs. Stotter's \\\"old\\\" garment.\\n\\n\\\"And now, my dear, be seated--yes, that's for us, twice\\nalready. Leentje, where are you hiding now? Can't you hear that\\nsomebody is ringing?--It's probably Juffrouw Zipperman. Juffrouw\\nZipperman is coming, too, you know.\\\"\\n\\nAgain I am at a loss: I don't know whether it was Juffrouw Zipperman\\nwho had rung, or somebody else. But the reader need not scold me for\\nwriting a story that I don't know myself. I cannot be sure whether it\\nwas Juffrouw Zipperman this time or Juffrouw Mabbel, from the bakery,\\nor Juffrouw Krummel, whose husband is at the bourse, or Juffrouw\\nLaps--but she didn't need to ring, as she lived in the house. Anyway,\\nby half past seven the entire company was assembled, and Stoffel was\\nsmoking his pipe as if his life depended upon it. Leentje had gone home\\nwithout her piece of bread and butter. She \\\"could get it to-morrow\\\";\\nto-day there was \\\"so much to do,\\\" and \\\"one can't do everything at once,\\nyou know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then she got another one right away--don't you know? One with\\na wart on her nose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, it's an ordeal one has with girls,\\\" said Juffrouw Pieterse. \\\"Take\\nanother piece, don't wait to be insisted upon; it's a cake from your\\nown dough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Excusez,\\\" said the Juffrouw from the bakery, with a mouth like a\\nrabbit, a style of mouth signifying graciousness and good breeding.\\n\\n\\\"You must eat more, or I shall think you don't like it.\\\" She had\\nbaked it herself.\\n\\n\\\"Then I cannot refuse, Juffrouw Pieterse. Oblig\\u00e9 and many thanks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you, Juffrouw Laps, what can I pass you?\\\" Juffrouw Laps selected\\nginger cake.\\n\\n\\\"Fill the cups, Trudie! Yes, Mrs. Stotter, when you are here you must\\ndrink with us. You are welcome to anything we've got. Pietje, wipe off\\na table--such a girl! And now go and look after the baby, and tell\\nher that I don't want to hear any more noise. Ah, Juffrouw Mabbel,\\nchildren are a great deal of trouble. And your little Sientje--how\\nis her cough now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We've got a magnetisier, but that isn't enough. We must have the\\nclairvoyange of the sonnebule.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't say so! One can hardly believe it. And when is he coming,\\nthe cler--cleek--clar----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's in the nerves, Juffrouw Zipperman. But he has the little nightcap\\nand nightgown, in which she has sweated, you know; and he says that\\nit will come all right now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who would have thought it! What will you do now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's just it; the sonnebule must tell us what to do.\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps could not agree to this.\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't do it--I wouldn't do it--not for anything in the world! I\\ntell you, what God does is all right. Just mark my words!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Juffrouw Laps; but the Juffrouw at the provision store did it,\\nand her child is lots better.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what you say, Juffrouw Mabbel, but I tell you there is\\nsomething in her eye that I don't like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What then, Juffrouw Laps?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She has a look, a look--and it's sin--I tell you it is. It's wrong,\\nit won't do. What God does is all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, Stoffel, talk some. You sit there like a stone. Recite a poem,\\nor tell us something about your school. Would you believe it, Juffrouw\\nMabbel, he knows a whole poem by heart. And he has memorized all the\\nverbs of the feminine gender.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother, what are you talking about?\\\" said Stoffel, displeased. \\\"Don't\\nyou see I'm smoking?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, dear, I meant when you were through smoking. Then you can repeat\\nthe words. You will be surprised, Juffrouw Zipperman, and wonder where\\nhe learned it all. How does it go? 'I would have been drunk, he would\\nhave been drunk'--of course, you know, he was not drunk, it belongs\\nwith the verbs. You will kill yourself laughing when he begins. Fill\\nthe cups, Trudie, and blow in the spout; there's a leaf over it.\\\"\\n\\nThe reader will not take it amiss, I trust, if I pass over the\\nsubsequent history of this leaf, and, too, make some deviations from\\nthe text of the conversation during the further course of Juffrouw\\nPieterse's tea-evening. Stoffel spun off his conjugations and the\\nladies fairly shrieked when he related how \\\"he had been drunk\\\" and\\nthat \\\"he would be drunk.\\\" Thereupon followed general and particular\\ncriticism of the neighbors. The Juffrouw below received her share,\\nas a matter of course: She was absent.\\n\\nReligion and faith play an important part. Juffrouw Laps was for\\norganizing a prayer-class. The preachers of to-day, she insisted,\\ntake their work too lightly and don't sweep out all the corners.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you, it's in the Bible that man is only man,\\\" she cried;\\n\\\"that's what I want to tell you. Man must not try to know better than\\nGod himself. Salvation comes through grace, and grace through faith;\\nbut if a man is not chosen, then he has no grace and can have no\\nfaith. That's the way he is damned, don't you see? I tell you, it's\\njust as certain as twice two--understand? And for that reason I want\\nto have a prayer-class. Not for the sake of money or profit--God help\\nme, no! At most just a trifle for the fair, or for New Year. What do\\nyou think of the plan, Juffrouw Mabbel?\\\"\\n\\nThat lady expressed the opinion that her husband would be opposed to\\nit, for he liked to go out of evenings, and then she must stay in the\\nshop. Besides, it was so difficult to get through with the work. No\\none could imagine what a laborious occupation baking was.\\n\\n\\\"What do you say, Juffrouw Zipperman? Don't you think it would be a\\ngo? I would serve coffee; and the people could leave something on the\\nsaucers. Really, I am not doing it for the money. We would begin with\\nthe Old Testament--and then--exercise, you know; practice--understand?\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Zipperman thought it would be very nice; but her son-in-law\\nhad said that the preachers are paid to do this, and that any\\nadditional \\\"exercise\\\" was merely an unnecessary expense.\\n\\n\\\"What do you say to it, Juffrouw Krummel? Don't you think that such\\na class--just a small class----\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Krummel said she practiced with her husband when he came\\nfrom the bourse.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps was now forced to turn to Mrs. Stotter, though she felt\\nthat she was letting herself down in appealing to a Vrouw.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my dear Juffrouw Laps, if you had been a midwife as long\\nas I have you'd take no interest in a prayer-class. Now there is\\nM'neer Littelman in Prince Street. I've been at his house--always in\\nrespectable houses--and he always said--it's a house with high steps,\\nand in the hall there's a big clock about the wind and rain--and he\\nalways said: 'Vrouw Stotter,' said he, 'you're a good woman,' said he,\\n'and a faithful midwife. I always tell the people that,' said he,\\n'and,' said he, 'all of my connection must send for you,' said he,\\n'but,' said he, 'when people tell you this you must act as if you\\ndidn't hear it'--thank you, Juffrouw Pieterse, my cup is turned\\nover. Just as I said: Everyone must know what he's doing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But just a little exercise like that, Mrs. Stotter!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's possible, it's possible. But I've had so much experience in such\\nthings. I go my own way; and that's the best way, too. For I've been in\\nthe home of M'neer Witte, who has an uncle in congress--for I always\\ngo to respectable places--and he always said, because he's so funny:\\n'Child-woman, child-woman, you're nothing but a child-woman.' I was\\njust going to say that I know what I'm doing, for I've seen a lot in\\nmy life. There's M'neer--what's his name? There in Prince Street--no,\\nno, Market Square. Oh, what is his name!\\\"\\n\\nThe reader will have noticed that Mrs. Stotter digressed from the\\ntheme. But other folk do the same.\\n\\n\\\"And Juffrouw Pieterse, what do you think of the idea? Just a little\\nexercise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my dear, I have exercise enough with my children. You don't know\\nwhat it means to bring up nine. I always worship with the children,\\nfor the Bible says--Trudie, go to the baby; I hear her again.\\\"\\n\\nThere was something noble in Trudie's gait as she walked into that\\nback room. One could see that she felt flattered by the transmission\\nto her of maternal dignity. Little Kee, the baby, was less flattered.\\n\\n\\\"What were we talking about? Yes, that is my religious service. The\\nchildren keep me busy. You don't know anything about it; if I bring\\nthem up properly--run, Pietje, and straighten out Simon. He's pinching\\nhis sister again; he always does it when there's company.\\\"\\n\\nSimon was straightened out.\\n\\n\\\"Whenever we have company the children behave so badly. There it\\ngoes again. Myntje, go and see what's the matter and tell them to go\\nto sleep.\\\"\\n\\nMyntje went, returning immediately with the report that they had\\n\\\"turned something over.\\\"\\n\\nGeneral indignation. Angry message from the Juffrouw below. It was\\nunpleasant for the Juffrouw below when the children of the Juffrouw\\nabove turned over things and flooded the back room. Terrible\\nexcitement.\\n\\nFinally the children were straightened out.\\n\\nJuffrouw Zipperman again sat in the corner where there was such a\\n\\\"draft.\\\" This only goes to show that earthly greatness has its dark\\nside, and that a son-in-law in the insurance business entitles one\\nto rheumatism.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps was greatly pleased with the hearty manner in which\\npunishment was meted out to the children. It was exactly according\\nto Scripture, she said; and then she cited a text or two in which\\nthe rod was prescribed. It's in the Bible somewhere, I don't know\\nwhere. The Bible mentions everything, and the \\\"rod\\\" especially.\\n\\n\\\"Now, Stoffel,\\\" said the hostess sweetly, \\\"recite something for\\nus.\\\" She wanted to show that her children could do something else\\nbesides pinch and turn things over.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know anything,\\\" said Stoffel, but without a trace of Socratic\\narrogance.\\n\\n\\\"Just say for us what you said the other day. Come, Stoffel. That's\\nthe way he always is, Juffrouw Mabbel. One has to pull him up on his\\nfeet before he will do anything. But then he goes all right. Forward,\\nStoffel! He's tired now. Teaching in such a school is hard work. Yes,\\nJuffrouw, he's as smart as he can be. Would you believe it? All words\\nare either masculine or feminine. Aren't they, Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No? But--and the other day you said--it's only to get him started,\\nyou know, Juffrouw Zipperman, it takes a little time, because he's\\nworn out with his school work--but you said that all words----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, mother. Masculine, feminine or neuter, I said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and still more,\\\" said Juffrouw Pieterse. \\\"You will be astonished\\nwhen you hear him. What do you suppose you are, Juffrouw Krummel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I? What I am?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, what you are--what you really are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am Juffrouw Krummel,\\\" she said, but doubtfully; for she read in\\nthe triumphant look of Juffrouw Pieterse and the tightly closed lips\\nof Stoffel that she might easily be something entirely different from\\nJuffrouw Krummel.\\n\\nThe tension did not need to be farther increased; so Juffrouw Pieterse\\npassed now from the special to the general. Her glance took in the\\nentire company.\\n\\n\\\"And you, too, Juffrouw Mabbel; and you, Juffrouw Laps; and you,\\nJuffrouw Zipperman; and you, Mrs. Stotter--what do you all think\\nyou are?\\\"\\n\\nNo one knew.\\n\\nThis will not be surprising to anyone who knows how difficult knowledge\\nof the \\\"self\\\" is; but Stoffel had something else in mind. There was\\na deeper meaning involved.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps was the first to answer, and she spoke with proud\\nself-sufficiency:\\n\\n\\\"I am Juffrouw Laps!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wrong, wrong--entirely wrong!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But for Heaven sake, am I not Juffrouw Laps?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Y-e-s. Of course you are Juffrouw Laps; but Stoffel didn't ask who\\nyou were, but what you were. There's the fine point.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What I am? I'm Dutch Reform!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Y-e-s. That you are, too; but--it isn't that. The question is,\\nWhat are you? Help her out, Stoffel.\\\"\\n\\nBetween puffs of smoke, and with the air of a professor, Stoffel\\nproceeded to \\\"help\\\":\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Laps, I wished to know what you were from a zo\\u00f6logical\\nstandpoint.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I won't have anything more to do with it,\\\" said Juffrouw Laps in\\nthe tone of one who feels that he is going to be insulted.\\n\\n\\\"I am a midwife,\\\" said Mrs. Stotter, \\\"and I'm going to stick to it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I am the baker's wife,\\\" cried Juffrouw Mabbel, with a positiveness\\nin her tone which showed her intention to hold to this opinion.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, certainly, Juffrouw Mabbel; but I mean from a zo\\u00f6logical\\nstandpoint.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If it's going to be indecent, I prefer to go home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I, too,\\\" added Juffrouwen Krummel and Zipperman. \\\"We came here to\\nbe entertained.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you're not going to get angry about it! I tell you, it's in\\nthe book, Stoffel--you will laugh when you hear it, Juffrouw Mabbel;\\nand the best part of it is, that it's in the book, and one can't say\\nanything against it. Tell her, Stoffel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Laps,\\\" said Stoffel with dignity--an important moment in\\nJuffrouw Pieterse's tea-evening had arrived--\\\"Juffrouw Laps, you are\\na sucking animal.\\\"\\n\\nI admit frankly that I cannot adequately describe the crisis that\\nfollowed these two words. If Stoffel had only said mammal, perhaps\\nthen my task would have been easier.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps's face took on all the different colors that are\\ngenerally supposed to express anger. She had been attacked more openly\\nthan the others, it is true; but her attitude toward the prayer-class\\nwould go to show that she was naturally polemical.\\n\\nIn French novels people used to turn green; but Juffrouw Laps did not\\nread French, so she stopped at a terrible violet and screamed--no,\\nshe didn't. She didn't scream anything; for she was choking for\\nbreath. But she did pulverize that piece of ginger cake; and she\\nlooked at Stoffel and his mother in a manner that would have been most\\ndamaging for her if those two persons had happened to die that night.\\n\\nImitating the trick of the cuttle-fish, no doubt unconsciously,\\nStoffel managed to escape this fatal stare by enveloping himself in a\\nheavy cloud of smoke. Juffrouw Pieterse, however, not being a smoker,\\nwas at the mercy of Juffrouw Laps. She stammered humbly: \\\"It's in\\nthe book, really it's in the book. Don't be angry, it's in the book.\\\"\\n\\nBy this time Juffrouw Laps was getting a little air, so much that\\nthere was now no danger of her suffocating. She threw the mutilated\\nremains of the ginger cake on the table and began:\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Pieterse, you are nothing but a low, vile, filthy--you\\nmay even be a sucking animal, you and your son too. I want you\\nto understand that I've always been respectable. My father sold\\ngrain, and nobody's ever been able to say anything against me! Ask\\neverybody about me--if I've ever run with men-folk, and such things;\\nand if I haven't always paid my debts. He was manager I would have\\nyou understand, and we lived over the chapter-house, for he was in\\nthe grain business, and you can ask about me there. Thank God, you\\ncan ask about me everywhere--do you hear? But never, never, never,\\nhas such a thing happened to me. What you put on me! If it wasn't\\nfor lowering myself I'd tell you what I think of you--you sucking\\nanimal, you and your son and your whole family. My father sold grain,\\nand I'm too respectable for you to----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But--it's in the book that way. For God's sake believe me; it's in\\nthe book.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just hold your lip about your book. Anybody who sells God's holy\\nword on the Ouwebrug needn't talk to me about books.\\\"\\n\\nThis accusation was false; for Walter, and not his mother, had sold\\nthe Bible; but this was no time for such fine distinctions.\\n\\n\\\"Stoffel, go get the book and show Juffrouw--my God, what shall I do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go to the Devil with your book and your sucking animals. You've got\\nnothing to show in your book. I know you--and your lout of a son,\\nand your wenches of daughters, that are growing up like----\\\"\\n\\nTruitje, Myntje and Pietje, understanding from this that there\\nwas something radically wrong with their growth, began to screech\\ntoo. Other members of the party bawled a word from time to time,\\nas opportunity presented itself. Then came another message from the\\nJuffrouw below. This time she threatened to call in the police. The\\nchildren, taking advantage of the general excitement to break the\\nban under which they had been placed, had left the bed and were\\nnow listening at the keyhole. Juffrouw Pieterse was calling for the\\ncamphor bottle, declaring that she was going to die; Mrs. Stotter\\nwas clamoring for her wrap--her \\\"old one\\\"; and Stoffel was playing\\ncuttle-fish as well as he could.\\n\\nAll had got up and were going to leave. They could \\\"put up with a\\ngood deal,\\\" but that was \\\"too much\\\"! Juffrouw Krummel was going to\\ntell her husband; Juffrouw Zipperman was going to let everybody in the\\ninsurance business know about it; Mrs. Stotter was going to relate the\\nwhole story to the gentleman in Prince Street; and Juffrouw Mabbel--I\\nforget whom she was going to tell it all to. In short, every one of\\nthem was going to see to it that the affair was well aired.\\n\\nWho knows but what these threats would have been carried out, if the\\ngood genius of the Pieterses had not at that moment caused someone\\nto ring the door-bell? It was that worthy gentleman whom we left in\\nsuch a state of pious despair at the close of the last chapter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n\\nYes, the door-bell rang. And it rang again: So it was \\\"for\\nus.\\\" Juffrouw Pieterse drew a long breath; and I must say, she did\\na very proper thing. While admitting that it is foolish to say what\\none would do if one were somebody else, still, in her place I should\\nhave drawn a long breath, too. Firstly, because I imagine she hadn't\\ndone this for a long time; secondly, because I know how, in adverse\\ncircumstances, every change and interruption gives one ground for\\nhope; and, finally, because I think Juffrouw Pieterse was human,\\njust like the rest of us.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, my dears,\\\" she said, \\\"be peaceable. It must be the gentlemen.\\\"\\n\\nThe ladies declared it couldn't be the gentlemen, because it was\\ntoo early for them; and this very doubt and uncertainty as to who it\\nmight be gave the crisis a favorable turn.\\n\\nMere uncertainty, even when in no way connected with what is occupying\\nus, has a sort of paralyzing effect. Besides, when one is interrupted\\nin one's anger, afterwards it is difficult to find the place where\\none left off.\\n\\nThis was Juffrouw Laps's experience; she tried it, but it wouldn't\\nwork. Her \\\"a sucking animal, a sucking animal!\\\" was smothered by,\\n\\\"What can it mean? He never comes before ten!\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse quickly availed herself of this diversion to get\\nthem all seated again.\\n\\nTrudie was commissioned to \\\"straighten out\\\" the children, who came off\\nrather badly. The hostess was just about to state a new zo\\u00f6logical\\nargument, which should establish peace between the hostile parties,\\nwhen the door opened and Master Pennewip stood before the agitated\\nassembly.\\n\\nHe, too, was agitated: the reader knows it.\\n\\nThe surprise caused by the arrival of this unexpected visitor had a\\nmost favorable effect on the peace negotiations. A truce was tacitly\\ndeclared, though not without the proviso, at least on Juffrouw Laps's\\npart, that hostilities should be reopened as soon as curiosity as to\\nPennewip's visit had been sufficiently satisfied. Indeed, she was\\nall the more willing for a truce, as it was evident from the man's\\nappearance that there was something momentous at hand. His wig cried\\nout fire and murder in unmistakable tones. And that was just what\\nthe good Juffrouw Laps liked.\\n\\n\\\"Good-evening, Juffrouw Pieterse; my humblest respects. I see you\\nhave company, but----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That 'doesn't make a bit of difference,' Master Pennewip. 'Come\\nright in and take a seat.'\\\"\\n\\nThese forms of expression were rigidly observed in the \\\"citizen\\npopulace,\\\" III, 7. c.\\n\\n\\\"Won't you drink a cup with us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Pieterse,\\\" he said with extreme dignity, \\\"I didn't come\\nhere simply to drink a cup of sage-milk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Master Pennewip, please be seated!\\\"\\n\\nIt wasn't easy; but the ladies made room and he was soon seated.\\n\\nHe cleared up his throat and looked about him with dignity. Then\\nhe drew a roll of manuscript from his pocket, disarranged his wig\\nand spoke:\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Pieterse! You are a worthy, respectable woman, and your\\nhusband sold shoes----\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse looked triumphantly at Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Master Pennewip, quite so; he did----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't interrupt me, Juffrouw Pieterse. Your departed husband sold\\nshoes. I have taught your children from little tots up to their\\nconfirmation. Haven't I, Juffrouw Pieterse?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Master Pennewip,\\\" she replied modestly; for she was afraid of\\nthat excessive dignity in Pennewip's manner and voice.\\n\\n\\\"And I just want to ask you, Juffrouw Pieterse, whether, during all\\nthis time that your children were in my school, you ever heard any\\ncomplaints--reasonable complaints--of the manner in which I, with\\nmy wife, instructed your children in reading, writing, arithmetic,\\nnational history, psalmody, sewing, knitting, drawing and religion? I\\nput the question to you, Juffrouw Pieterse, and wait for a reply.\\\"\\n\\nAn awful silence followed this speech. The Juffrouw below had every\\nreason to be satisfied.\\n\\n\\\"But, Master Pennewip----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't want any 'but', Juffrouw Pieterse. I ask you, whether you\\nhave had any complaints. I mean, of course, well grounded complaints\\nabout my instruction in reading, writing, arithmetic----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, no, Master Pennewip, I have no complaints; but----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So-oo? No complaints? Well, then I will explain to you--where is\\nyour son Walter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Walter? Dear me! Hasn't he come home, Trudie? He went to take a\\nwalk with the Halleman boys. They are such respectable children,\\nMaster Pennewip, and they live----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So! With the Hallemans--who go to the French school! Aha, and\\nthat's it? So--from the Hallemans! And he learns such things from the\\nHallemans--the Hallemans III, 7, a2, perhaps 'a'--yes, who knows but\\nthat it might be II. It's no wonder--immorality, viciousness--at the\\nFrench school! And now, Juffrouw Pieterse, I want to tell you that\\nyour son----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What did you say?\\\"\\n\\nMaster Pennewip looked about him as if he were drinking in the\\nbreathless silence that had fallen over his hearers.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps hastened to repay with compound interest that triumphant\\nlook of the hostess, while that lady, thoroughly miserable, was making\\nfrequent use of the camphor bottle. She was not so much mortified that\\nJuffrouw Laps should hear something else unfavorable about Walter,\\nwho had caused them so much trouble, as angry that she should be\\nthe witness of an accusation that would give her a new weapon in the\\nzo\\u00f6logical fray.\\n\\n\\\"Didn't I tell you so? Nothing good will ever come to this Walter. A\\nboy that begins with the Bible will end with something else. Yes,\\nMaster Pennewip, I'm not surprised--I shouldn't be surprised at\\nanything he did. I've seen it coming for a long time. But what\\nshouldn't one expect from a family----\\\"\\n\\nAs quick as a flash Juffrouw Pieterse saw here her opportunity to\\nrecover her lost advantage. Stoffel had said it was in the book;\\nbut a teacher must know whatever is in a book. Therefore----\\n\\n\\\"Master Pennewip,\\\" she cried, \\\"Is it true that Juffrouw Laps is a\\nsucking animal?\\\"\\n\\nI am convinced that Pennewip brought this question under a special\\ncategory for \\\"peculiar overflowings of the heart,\\\" seeing that it\\nfollowed upon his unfinished accusation against Walter. He looked\\nover his glasses and slowly described with his eye a circle, peopled\\nwith women holding their breath, heads and necks stretched out and\\nmouths wide open. The attitude of Juffrouw Laps was threatening above\\neverything else, and said quite distinctly: Answer or die! Am I a\\nsucking animal?\\n\\n\\\"With whom have I the honor to speak?\\\" he asked, probably not\\nconsidering that this question made the matter still more mysterious,\\ngiving the impression that Laps's animal quality depended upon her\\nname, age, place of residence, family relations, etc.\\n\\n\\\"I am Juffrouw Laps,\\\" she said, \\\"and live down stairs in the front\\npart of the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah--so! Yes, indeed you belong to the class of sucking animals.\\\"\\n\\nA ten-fold sigh was heaved; and Juffrouw Pieterse was again\\ntriumphant. In politics and the citizen populace complete equilibrium\\nis impossible. The parties or powers are in continual motion, first\\none in the ascendency, then the other.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps, who had not been able to accomplish anything with pride,\\nnow attempted good humor.\\n\\n\\\"But Master Pennewip,\\\" she said sweetly, \\\"how can you say such a\\nthing? My father was in the grain business and----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Laps, answer me one question.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Master Pennewip, but----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Answer me, Juffrouw Laps, where do you live?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where I live? Why, in my room, down stairs--two windows--front\\nentrance----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You miss the significance of my question entirely, Juffrouw Laps. The\\nmeaning would be similar if I were to ask you if you belonged to that\\nclass of organisms that live in oyster-shells.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, Juffrouw Laps,\\\" cried the triumphant hostess, \\\"that's the\\npoint--the main point!\\\"\\n\\nAnd Stoffel added that it was really and truly the main point.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps saw that she was hopelessly lost, for she had to admit to\\nherself that she didn't usually reside in an oyster-shell. She looked\\nat the teacher with astonishment; but he paid no attention at all to\\nthe effect of his questions. Assuming a sort of legal manner--which\\nwas closely imitated by his wig, he continued:\\n\\n\\\"Can you live in water? Have you gills?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In water? But--Master Pennewip----\\\"\\n\\nWig to the left, which meant: No, but!\\n\\n\\\"Or half in water, half on land?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Master Pennewip, how should I----\\\"\\n\\nWig to the right: No subterfuges.\\n\\n\\\"Answer me, Juffrouw Laps, have you cold blood? Do you bring living\\nyoung into the world?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is a sin, Master Pennewip!\\\"\\n\\nThe wig now looked like a battering-ram, anticipating the nature of\\nthe next question.\\n\\n\\\"Can you lay eggs, Juffrouw Laps? I only ask you the question. Can\\nyou lay eggs? Eh?\\\"\\n\\nShe said she couldn't.\\n\\n\\\"Then you are a sucking animal, Juffrouw Laps!\\\"\\n\\nThe wig was in the middle again resting quietly. It had vanquished\\nJuffrouw Laps.\\n\\nI wonder what the reader's idea is of the effect produced on the\\ncompany by this terrible sentence, against which there could be no\\nappeal. There was something pitiless in Pennewip's manner, and in\\nhis contracted eyebrows there was no intimation of mercy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n\\nThe attentive reader who knows human nature will naturally wish to\\nknow why I closed the last chapter so tamely, and why that zo\\u00f6logical\\nproblem which, only a short time before had caused such a violent\\nexplosion, was now allowed to rest in peace.\\n\\nThere are three reasons for this.\\n\\nFirstly, the women had been so wrought up that they were now exhausted.\\n\\nSecondly, Juffrouw Laps, the shrewd leader of the fight, looked over\\nthe battlefield and, without thinking of the famous battle between\\nthe Horatii and the Curiatii, saw with innate tactical talent the\\ncorrectness of \\\"divide and conquer.\\\" With the forces Stotter, Mabbel,\\nKrummel and Zipperman against the house of Pieterse--that was all\\nright. But now that the house was supported by Pennewip's powerful\\nhand, it was prudent to withdraw from the battle. For who could\\nguarantee her that she might depend upon her allies? What assurance\\nhad she that the midwife, or even Juffrouw Zipperman would not go over\\nto the enemy?--if only out of deference to the versatile wig! No, no,\\nno! She wouldn't risk her rhetorical artillery in such a doubtful\\nengagement! She was content to say to herself, \\\"I will get even\\nwith you later.\\\" Imagining her, with all her relations to society,\\nmultiplied by twenty or thirty millions, we would have read the next\\nday in this or that official Laps organ something like this:\\n\\n\\\"Our relations with the Pietersian empire are most cordial. The\\nrecent friendly meeting between the two sovereigns was merely that\\nthey might have the mutual pleasure of seeing one another, and had\\nno political significance whatever. It will be seen how unfounded\\nwere those rumors of 'strained relations,' which were said to have\\nbeen brought about by a discussion of certain characteristics of our\\npopular princess. The reader will recall that we never gave credence\\nto those rumors, and reported them with great reserve.\\\"\\n\\nThirdly. The third and chief cause of the armistice\\nwas--curiosity. Under the present changed circumstances whoever\\nbetrayed any anger would have to leave; and whoever left would not\\nfind out why Master Pennewip had come, or what new crime Walter had\\ncommitted. Again we see the truth of the proposition, that everything\\nhas its good side.\\n\\n\\\"But, Master Pennewip,\\\" asked Juffrouw Pieterse--she threw the\\nsubdued sucking animal a look that was like a triumphant telegram,\\nand read: Where are you now?--\\\"but Master Pennewip, what has Walter\\nbeen doing now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, what has he been up to this time,\\\" added Juffrouw Laps, delighted\\nthat the conversation had taken this turn, and that she was now to\\nhear about Walter's latest sin.\\n\\nFor the sinner is a thing in which pious persons find much\\nedification. As we have already seen, Juffrouw Laps was fond of\\nedification.\\n\\nPennewip was just on the point of beginning his indictment when the\\ndoor-bell rang. It rang again: \\\"It's for us\\\"--and in a moment our\\ntruant walked into the room.\\n\\nHe was paler than usual, and with good reason; for strange things\\nhad happened to him since Fancy had lifted him up and borne him away.\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Pieterse,\\\" began Pennewip, \\\"my school is famous, even as\\nfar away as Kattenburg. Do you hear me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Master Pennewip.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I repeat it: Famous! And, too, chiefly on account of the fine moral\\nthere--I mean, of course, in my school. Religion and morality occupy\\nthe first place in my school. I could show you verses on the Deity--but\\nI pass over that. It is sufficient for you to know that my school is\\nfamous as far as--but what am I talking about--I've even had a boy\\nfrom Wittenburg; and I was once consulted about the education of a\\nboy whose father lived at Muiderberg.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Master Pennewip!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Juffrouw, I still have the letter and could show it to you. The\\nman was a gravedigger--the boy painted inappropriate figures on\\nthe coffins. And just for this reason I feel it my duty to tell you\\nthat I don't intend to see my school lose its good name through that\\ngood-for-nothing boy of yours there!\\\"\\n\\nPoor Walter had fallen from the clouds. That sounded quite different\\nfrom a papal appointment--which he really no longer cared for, as he\\nhad just received another appointment that pleased him better.\\n\\nHis mother wanted to pass immediately to what she called her \\\"divine\\nworship\\\" and give him a sound thrashing, in order to satisfy the\\nteacher that religion and morality took the first place in her\\nhouse, too.\\n\\nBut the teacher found it preferable to tell the party what the\\ntrouble was, and incidentally to strengthen the feeling of guilt in\\nthe patient.\\n\\n\\\"Your son belongs to the class of robbers, murderers, ravishers of\\nwomen, incendiaries----\\\"\\n\\nThat was all.\\n\\n\\\"Holy grace! Heavenly righteousness! Compassionate Christian souls! Ah,\\ndivine and human virtue, is it possible! What must we endure!\\\"\\n\\nI cannot always be exact; but, in general, such was the flood of\\nexclamations that all but swept away that ten-year-old robber,\\nmurderer, ravisher of women and incendiary.\\n\\n\\\"I am going to read you something from his hand,\\\" said the teacher,\\n\\\"and then if anybody still doubts the boy's viciousness----\\\"\\n\\nAll tacitly promised to have no doubts.\\n\\nThe work that the teacher read was indeed of such a nature as to leave\\nsmall room for doubts; and I, who have chosen Walter for my hero,\\nanticipate difficulty in convincing the reader that he was not so\\nbad as he seemed--after his\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Robber Song.\\\"\\n\\n    \\\"On the steed,\\n    Off I speed,\\n    With helmet on head\\n    And a sword in my hand and the enemy dead;\\n    Quick, away!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Christian souls,\\\" cried the whole party, \\\"is he mad?\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Rather late,\\n    Near the gate\\n    A push and a blow,\\n    Vanquished dragoon, Margrave laid low----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Heaven save us, what has he against the Margrave,\\\" wailed the mother.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"For the spoil!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see, it's for booty,\\\" said Juffrouw Laps. \\\"I told you so:\\nHe began with the Bible, he'll end with----\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"And the prize--\\n    Pretty eyes----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Did you ever hear the like--he has scarcely shed his milk teeth!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"And the prize--\\n    Pretty eyes--\\n    She was bought with steel----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"With ste-e-l!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"And the prize--\\n    Pretty eyes--\\n    She was bought with steel;\\n    I bore her away to the cave just to feel\\n    How it seemed.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Heavenly grace, what is he going to do in the cave?\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"In my arm,\\n    Free from harm\\n    Lay the maid as we sped;\\n    Her cries, sweet complaints, and the tears----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Oh, blessed peace, and the poor thing crying!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Her cries, sweet complaints, and the tears she shed--\\n    O, delight!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"And he calls that delight! I'm getting right cold.\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Then again,\\n    O'er the plain----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Holy Father, there he goes again!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Then again,\\n    O'er the plain.\\n    Right and left, nothing spurned,\\n    Here a villa destroyed or a cloister burned\\n    For fun.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"The Devil is in that boy. For fun!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Farther yet,\\n    I forget--\\n    But the deeds they were dire,\\n    And the road was marked with blood and fire\\n    And revenge!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Mercy on us! What had they done to him!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Revenge's sweet,\\n    And is meet\\n    For the King of the World----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Is he crazy? I'll make him a king!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Revenge's sweet\\n    And is meet\\n    For the King of the World,\\n    Who alone is supreme, with a banner unfurled\\n    Forever!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"What sort of a thing is he talking about?\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"All! Hurrah!\\n    But, I say----\\\"\\n\\n\\nEverybody shuddered.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"All! Hurrah!\\n    But, I say\\n    No pardon shall be lavished,\\n    The men shall be hanged and the women----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Trudie, Trudie, the camphor bottle! You see--I----\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"The men shall be hanged and the women ravished----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"The camphor bottle! Trudie, Trudie!\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"For pleasure!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"For pleasure,\\\" repeated the teacher in a grave-yard voice, \\\"for\\npleasure!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He--does--it--for--pleasure!\\\"\\n\\nThe company was stupefied. Even Stoffel's pipe had gone out.\\n\\nBut Walter's was not a nature to be easily disturbed. After his mother\\nhad beaten him till she came to her senses again, he went to bed\\nin the little back room, far from dissatisfied with the day's work,\\nand was soon dreaming of Fancy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n\\nOn the next day things had largely resumed their wonted course. That\\nsomeone may not charge me with carelessness, or indifference towards\\nthe persons with whom we spent a pleasant evening, I will remark\\nin passing that Juffrouw Mabbel was again busy with her baking and\\n\\\"clairvoyange,\\\" and that Mrs. Stotter had resumed her activities with\\nthe stork. Those unfortunate creatures who were committed to her care\\nshe condemned to lie motionless for two or three months--perhaps to\\ngive the newly born an idea of their new career, and, at the same time,\\nto punish them for the shameful uproar they had caused by their birth.\\n\\nAs for Master Pennewip, he was busy, as usual, educating future\\ngrandparents of the past. His wig had not yet recovered from the\\nexcitement of the night before and was longing for Sunday.\\n\\nKlaasje van der Gracht had been awarded the prize with an impressive,\\n\\\"Keep on that way, my boy\\\"; and he kept on. I still see poems in\\nthe papers whose clearness, conciseness and sublimity betray his\\nmaster hand. I have heard that he died of smallpox--he had not been\\nvaccinated; it will be remembered--but I consider it my duty to\\nprotect him from any such slander. A genius does not die; otherwise\\nit wouldn't be worth while to be born a genius. Still, if Klaas had\\ndied like other people, his spirit would have lived in those coming\\nafter him. And that is a beautiful immortality.\\n\\nThe family de Wilde, too, has not died out, and will not die. I am\\ncertain of it.\\n\\nJuffrouw Krummel asked her husband if she was really a \\\"sucking\\nanimal.\\\" Being from the bourse, and having much worldly wisdom, he\\nreplied after reflection that of such things he didn't believe more\\nthan half he heard. \\\"In this case the last half,\\\" he added--but softly.\\n\\nJuffrouw Zipperman had caught a cold; but was still able to boast\\nabout her son-in-law. She was a \\\"respectable woman.\\\" Only she couldn't\\nendure for Juffrouw Laps to talk so much about \\\"virtue,\\\" and the\\n\\\"respectability\\\" of her father, who was \\\"in the grain business.\\\" Old\\nMan Laps, she said, was not in, but under the grain business. He had\\ncarried sacks of grain, but that was quite different from selling\\ngrain. For the man who sells is much bigger than the man who\\ncarries. Juffrouw, therefore, had been making misleading statements.\\n\\nTrudie and her sisters had decked themselves out as well as possible\\nand were sitting at the window. When young people passed by they\\nlooked as if they had never in their lives straightened out anybody.\\n\\nThe Juffrouw in the rear below told the grocer that she was going\\nto move out; for it was just scandalous, simply scandalous the way\\nthe Pieterses carried on in their back room; that she couldn't leave\\nanything uncovered.\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse was busy with her household, and looked like\\na working woman. From time to time she had \\\"divine service\\\" with\\nthe children, who, if they could have had their choice, would have\\npreferred to have been born among the Alfures, Dajaks, or some other\\nbenighted people whose religion is less strenuous.\\n\\nI am glad to be able to say that Juffrouw Laps had passed a good\\nnight. I should like to tell more about her, but I don't care to\\nexhaust myself.\\n\\nStoffel had returned to school, and was trying to inspire the boys with\\ncontempt for riches. He was using on them a poem that had probably\\nbeen written in a garret by some poor devil or other whose wealth\\ngave him little cause for complaint. The boys were inattentive,\\nand seemed not to grasp the peculiar pleasure in having no money to\\nbuy marbles. Stoffel attributed their hard-heartedness to Walter's\\ncrazy ideas: They had heard of his attack on the Margrave and of that\\nremarkable visit to the cave.\\n\\nAnd Walter?\\n\\nHe still lived in expectation of the punishment he deserved so\\nrichly. For his mother had given him to understand repeatedly that\\nthe little \\\"straightening out\\\" of the evening before was merely for\\npractice, and that the reward of his sin would be delayed till she\\ncould speak with the preacher about it.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile Walter didn't know what to do. He couldn't return\\nto school: Pennewip had closed for him that fountain of knowledge.\\n\\nNor was he allowed to go out for a walk. \\\"Who knows what he will do\\nif I let him out of my sight?\\\" said his mother, who was presumably\\nafraid that he might make a fresh attack on the cloisters. As a matter\\nof fact, she denied him this privilege merely because Walter asked it.\\n\\nShe expressed the opinion that it was best not to let bad children\\nhave their own way.\\n\\nIf Walter had been right wise, he would have pretended to be thoroughly\\nin love with that dark back room; then, for his moral improvement,\\nhe would have been chased down the steps, and away to his sawmills.\\n\\nBut Walter was not smart.\\n\\nHe was forbidden to go into the front room because the young ladies\\ndid not care to see him.\\n\\nThat back room was more than dark: It was narrow, and dirty,\\nand reeked with all the fumes of \\\"III, 7, c.\\\" But Walter was used\\nto all this and much more. He had always been a martyr--bandages,\\npoultices, bandy legs, biblical history, rickets, poems on goodness,\\nevening prayers, the judgment day, hobgoblins for wicked children,\\nclosed eyes before and after the slice of bread, sleeping with crooked\\nknees, committing sins, fear for the torn breeches, \\\"divine service\\\"\\nwith and without sensible accompaniment!\\n\\nThat droll robber song, whose origin we know so well, shows how easily\\nhis childish soul was moved by whatever seemed great to him. He was a\\npure child, and he was a good boy. He wouldn't have hurt a fly. The\\ncriminal character of his song was due to his desire to grasp what\\nis greater than everything else and to be the leader in that world\\ncreated by his childish fancy.\\n\\nRobber--good! But a first-class robber, a robber of robbers, a robber\\nwithout mercy--for pleasure!\\n\\nAs to the gross mistreatment of women mentioned in his song, he had\\nno idea what it meant. He used the word for the sake of rhyme, and\\nbecause from certain sentences in his book he had got the impression\\nthat it must afford great pleasure.\\n\\nIf, perchance, for those fourteen stivers Grandisson--weary\\nremembrance--had fallen into his hands, his Wednesday's poem would have\\nbeen quite different. No doubt he would have sought a reconciliation\\nwith the butcher's Keesje, forgiving him completely all his liberties\\nwith \\\"Holland nobility\\\" and even presenting him a few slate pencils.\\n\\nFor that is the striking characteristic of spirits such as\\nWalter's. Whatever they are, they are that with all their might,\\nalways going further in any direction than they would seem to be\\nwarranted in doing by the mere external circumstances.\\n\\nFrom such characters we could hope much, if through some chance--i. e.,\\na natural cause, which we call chance, because we do not understand\\nit and are ashamed to admit our ignorance--if through some chance\\nthey were not born among people who do not understand them, and,\\ntherefore, mistreat them.\\n\\nIt is one of our peculiarities that we like to mistreat anyone\\nwhose soul is differently organized from ours. How does the watch\\nmove? asks the child, and cannot rest until he has torn apart the\\nwheels he could not understand. There the watch lies in pieces, and\\nthe little miscreant excuses himself with the remark that he just\\nwanted to see how it was made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n\\nWalter sat with his elbows on the table, his chin resting in his\\nhands. He seemed to be deeply interested in Leentje's sewing, but\\nwe shall see in a moment that his thoughts were elsewhere, and, too,\\nfar away from III. 7, c.\\n\\nThey had forbidden her to speak to the shameless rascal, and only\\noccasionally, when Juffrouw Pieterse left the room, did she have an\\nopportunity to whisper to him a few words of comfort. To be sure,\\nshe noticed that Walter was not so sad as we should expect one to be\\nwho was caught in between the thrashing of yesterday and the priest of\\nto-morrow. This gentleman was to come to-morrow to settle the matter.\\n\\n\\\"But, Walter, how could you speak of burning cloisters!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, I meant--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the Count--what had he done?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was a Margrave--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What sort of a count is that? I'll bet he was one out of another\\nhouse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it was Amalia's father--but that isn't it. I have something to\\ntell you, Leentje--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Amalia--who is Amalia?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was my bride, but--Leentje, I wanted to tell you something--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your bride! Are you mad, Walter? Your bride?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, she was; but now no more. I was going to help her--but a duck\\ncame--but that isn't it, Leentje. Now I see it all--sh. I swam by--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who, what? Swam by?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By Amalia. She sat on the rushes--now I understand it all--I am--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't understand a word, Walter. But the women--why did you\\nwant to----\\\"\\n\\nPoor innocent Leentje.\\n\\n\\\"The women were in the book--but listen, I am--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the cloisters?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That has nothing to do with it--I know everything now. Listen Leentje,\\nI am--sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For Heaven sake, Walter, what's the matter with you? You look as if\\nyou were mad.\\\"\\n\\nWalter had a vision. He stretched himself up, cast a proud glance\\nat the beams in the ceiling, placed his right hand over his heart,\\nextended his left, as if he were draping a Spanish mantle about\\nhim--remember that he had never been in a theatre--and said:\\n\\n\\\"Leentje, I am a prince.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment his mother came in, boxed his ears and sent him out\\nof the room.\\n\\n\\n\\nWalter's principality was in the moon--no, much farther away.\\n\\nIn the following the reader shall learn how he had attained to this\\nnew dignity.\\n\\nLong before the beginning of this story--yes, a long time before\\nthis--there was a queen of spirits, just like in \\\"Hans Heiling.\\\" Her\\nname was A----o.\\n\\nShe did not live in a cave, but held her court far up in the clouds;\\nand this was airier and more suitable for a queen.\\n\\nShe wore a necklace of stars, and a sun was set in her signet-ring.\\n\\nWhenever she went forth, the clouds flew about like dust, and with\\na motion of her hand she drove away the firmaments.\\n\\nHer children played with planets as with marbles, and she complained\\nthat it was so difficult for her to find them again when they had\\nrolled away under the furniture.\\n\\nThe little son of the queen, Prince Upsilon, was peevish over this\\nand was continually calling for more playthings.\\n\\nThe queen then gave him a sack of siriuses; but in a short time these,\\ntoo, were all lost. It was Upsilon's own fault: He ought to have paid\\nmore attention to his playthings.\\n\\nThey tried to satisfy him as best they could, but no matter what they\\ngave him, he always wanted something else, something larger. This\\nwas a defect in the character of the little prince.\\n\\nThe mother, who, as queen of the spirits, was a very intelligent woman,\\nthought it would be a good idea for the little prince to accustom\\nhimself to privations.\\n\\nShe issued an order, therefore, that for a certain time Upsilon was\\nto have no playthings.\\n\\nThe order was carried out. Everything was taken away from him,\\neven the comet that he and his little sister Omicron happened to be\\nplaying with.\\n\\nPrince Upsilon was somewhat stubborn. He so far forgot himself one\\nday as to speak disrespectfully to his mother.\\n\\nEven Princess Omicron was contaminated by his example--nothing is\\nworse than a bad example--and violently threw her pallet against the\\nuniverse. That was not becoming in a girl.\\n\\nNow, in the kingdom of spirits, there was a law to the effect, that\\nanyone showing disrespect toward the queen, or throwing anything\\nagainst the universe, should be deprived of all titles and dignities\\nfor a certain length of time.\\n\\nPrince Upsilon became a grain of sand.\\n\\nAfter he had behaved himself well in this capacity for a few centuries\\nhe received the news that he had been promoted to be a moss plant.\\n\\nThen one morning he woke up and found himself a coral zo\\u00f6phyte.\\n\\nThat occurred about the time that man began to cook his food.\\n\\nHe was industrious, building up islands and continents on the earth. In\\nrecognition of his zeal he was turned into a crab.\\n\\nIn this capacity, too, there could be no complaint against him,\\nand he was soon transferred to the class of sea-serpents.\\n\\nHe played some innocent pranks on sailors, but he never harmed\\nanyone. Soon he received four feet and the rank of a mastodon, with\\nthe privilege of roaming over the land.\\n\\nWith the self-control of a philosopher he entered upon his new life,\\nbusying himself with geological investigations.\\n\\nA few centuries later--remember that in the kingdom of spirits all time\\ntaken together is only as a short quarter of an hour--or to speak more\\ncorrectly, that all time is nothing. For time was made merely for man,\\nfor his amusement, and given to him just as we give picture books to\\nchildren. For spirits, present, past and future are all the same. They\\ncomprehend yesterday, to-day and to-morrow at a glance, just as one\\nreads a word without spelling it out. What was and is going to be, is.\\n\\nThe Egyptians and Phoenicians knew that very well, but Christians\\nhave forgotten it.\\n\\nFancy knew that Walter could not read, so she related Upsilon's story\\nto him, just as I am doing for the reader.\\n\\nSome centuries later he had become an elephant; then a moment later,\\ni. e., about ten years before the opening of my story--I mean years\\nas we mortals reckon them--he was elevated to the class of man.\\n\\nI don't know what sins he may have committed as an elephant.\\n\\nAnyway, Fancy had said, that in order to return to his station as a\\nspirit-prince in a short time and escape any further degradation it\\nwas necessary for him to be diligent and well behaved in his present\\nstate, and not write any robber songs, or slip out things and sell\\nthem--even if it was only a Bible.\\n\\nAnd, too, he must become reconciled to seeing Juffrouw Pieterse\\nwithout a train on her dress. Fancy said it couldn't be helped.\\n\\nThis \\\"Fancy\\\" must have been some lady at his mother's court, who\\nvisited him in his exile to comfort and encourage him, so that\\nhe wouldn't think they were punishing him because they were angry\\nwith him.\\n\\nShe promised to visit him from time to time. \\\"But,\\\" asked Walter,\\n\\\"how is my little sister getting along?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's being punished, too. You know the law. She is patient with\\nit all and promises to improve. At first she was a fire-ball; but\\nshe behaved so nicely that she was soon changed to a moon-beam; and\\nalso in this state there was nothing against her. It seemed to be\\na pleasure for her; and it was all her mother could do to keep from\\nshortening the punishment. She was soon turned into vapor, and stood\\nthe test well; for she filled the universe. That was about the time\\nyou began to eat grass. Soon she was a butterfly. But your mother\\ndid not consider this suitable for a girl and had her changed into\\na constellation. There she stands before us now.\\\"\\n\\nIt often happens that we do not see a thing because it is too big.\\n\\n\\\"Look,\\\" said Fancy. \\\"There--to the right! No, further--there,\\nthere--the north star! That is her left eye. You can't see her right,\\nbecause she is bending over towards Orion, the doll which she holds\\nin her lap and caresses.\\\"\\n\\nWalter saw it plainly enough and cried: \\\"Omicron, Omicron!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, prince,\\\" said the lady of the court, \\\"that will not do. Each\\nmust undergo his punishment alone. It's already a great concession\\nthat you two are imprisoned in the same universe. Recently, when your\\nlittle brothers flooded the milky way with sin, they were separated\\ncompletely.\\\"\\n\\nWalter was sad. How gladly would he have kissed his little\\nsister!--that group of stars nursing the doll.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Fancy, let me be with Omicron.\\\"\\n\\nFancy said neither yes nor no.\\n\\nShe looked as if she were reflecting on the possibility of\\naccomplishing the almost impossible.\\n\\nWalter, taking courage from her hesitation, repeated his request.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, let me live with my little sister again, even if I have to eat\\ngrass or build continents--I will eat and build with pleasure, if I\\nmay only be with Omicron.\\\"\\n\\nProbably Fancy was afraid to promise something beyond her power;\\nand she was sorry not to be able to give her promise.\\n\\n\\\"I will ask,\\\" she whispered, \\\"and now----\\\"\\n\\nWalter rubbed his eyes. There was the bridge and the ditch. He heard\\nthe ducks cackling from the distance. He saw his mills again. Yes, yes,\\nthere they were. But their name was no longer--what was their name?\\n\\nThe mills were called \\\"Morning Hour\\\" and \\\"Eagle,\\\" and they called\\nout just like other sawmills: \\\"Karre, karre, kra, kra----\\\"\\n\\nThereupon Walter went home. We have already seen what awaited him\\nthere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n\\nThe preacher had come and gone. Sentence had been passed and the\\npenalty paid. But Walter was depressed and despondent. Leentje did\\nher best to put some animation into him, but in vain. Perhaps it was\\nbecause she no longer understood her ward.\\n\\nThose confidential communications of Walter's were beyond her\\ncomprehension; and often she looked at him as if she doubted his\\nsanity. From her meagre weekly allowance she saved a few doits,\\nthinking to gladden Walter's heart with some ginger cakes, which he\\nhad always enjoyed. It was no use: Walter's soul had outgrown ginger\\ncakes. This discovery caused Leentje bitter pain.\\n\\n\\\"But, my dear child, be reasonable, and don't worry over such\\nfoolishness. This Fancy, or whatever the creature's name is, has\\nmocked you; or you have dreamed it all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, no, Leentje. It's all true. I know everything she said,\\nand it's all true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Walter, that story about your sister--you would have known that\\nlong ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did know it, but I had forgotten it. I knew everything that Fancy\\ntold me. It had only slipped out of my mind. When she spoke, then it\\nall came back to me distinctly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will go to those mills some day,\\\" said Leentje.\\n\\nAnd she did it. After Walter's description she was able to find\\nthe place where that important meeting had taken place. She saw\\nthe timbers, the dirt, the ducks, the meadow--everything was there,\\neven the ashes,--everything except Fancy and her stories.\\n\\nNor could Walter find Fancy now. In vain did he go out walking with\\nthose respectable Halleman boys as often as he was in the way at\\nhome. For hours he would stand on the bridge and listen to the rattling\\nof the sawmills; but they told him nothing, and Fancy would not return.\\n\\n\\\"She has too much to do at my mother's court,\\\" Walter sighed, and\\nwent home sad and disappointed.\\n\\nWhen he looked out the window and saw the beautiful stars twinkling\\nencouragement to him, he cheered up a little. His sadness was less\\nbitter, but it was still there. Pain passed into home-sickness,\\na sweet longing for home, and with tears in his eyes, but no longer\\ndespairing, he whispered \\\"Omicron, Omicron!\\\"\\n\\nWho heard that call, or understood his grief over his exile? Who\\nobserved how that sigh for the \\\"higher\\\" and that fiery desire had\\npassed into a nobler state?\\n\\nAfter long deliberations and Walter's express promise to do better,\\nMaster Pennewip had at last been prevailed upon to allow our young\\nrobber to return to school. He now had the opportunity to perfect\\nhimself in verse-writing, penmanship, verbs, \\\"Holland Counts\\\" and\\nother equally important things.\\n\\nThe teacher said that the boy at Muiderberg had been still worse,\\nand he had known what to prescribe. Walter would do all right now,\\nhe thought; but Juffrouw Pieterse must get another pastor, for the\\npresent one belonged to the class of \\\"drinkers.\\\" This she did. Walter\\nwas to receive religious instruction from a real preacher.\\n\\nI don't remember the title of the book, but the first lines were:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Q. From whom did you and everything in existence have its origin?\\\"\\n\\n\\nWalter wanted to say, From my mother; but the book said:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Ans. From God, who made everything out of nothing.\\\"\\n\\n    \\\"Q. How do you know that?\\\"\\n\\n    \\\"Ans. From nature and revelation.\\\"\\n\\n\\nWalter didn't know what it meant, but like the good-natured,\\nobedient child that he was, he repeated faithfully what he had\\nmemorized from the book. It was annoying for him to have his\\nSundays spoiled by recitations in the Kings of Israel--days so well\\nsuited for rambling. He was jealous of the Jews, who were always led\\naway--a misfortune that seemed delightful to him. But he worked away\\npatiently, and was not the worst of those apprentices in religion. At\\nthe end of the year he received a book containing three hundred and\\nsixty-five scriptural texts, twenty-one prayers, as many graces,\\nthe Lord's Prayer, the ten commandments and the articles of faith. It\\nalso contained directions for using it--once a day through the year,\\nthree times a day for a week, etc., etc.; or simply use as needed. On\\na leaf pasted in the front of the book was written:\\n\\n\\n                           To Walter Pieterse\\n                                  as a\\n                                 Reward\\n                                  for\\n                         Excellent recitations\\n                                 in the\\n                              Noorderkerk\\n                               and as an\\n                             Encouragement\\n                         for him to continue to\\n                               Honor God\\n                  in the manner in which he has begun.\\n\\n\\nUnder this were the names of the preacher and the officers of the\\nchurch, ornamented with flourishes that would have put Pennewip\\nto shame.\\n\\nThe outward respectability of the Hallemans continued to increase. The\\nparents of these children had hired a garden on the \\\"Overtoom.\\\" That\\nwas so \\\"far out,\\\" they said; and then they \\\"couldn't stay in the\\ncity forever.\\\" Besides, the expense was \\\"not so much\\\"; for there was\\none gardener for everybody; and then, there were plenty of berries\\ngrowing there, and that was always very nice. There would be grass\\nenough for bleaching the linen--an important item, for just lately,\\nsaid the mother of the Hallemans, there had been iron-rust in Betty's\\ndress. For that reason it was the very thing to rent the garden;\\nand if people said anything about it, it would only be because they\\nwere jealous. And, too, there was a barrel there for rainwater; and\\nMrs. Karels had said it leaked, but it was not true; for everyone\\nmust know what he's doing; but when you do anything, everybody\\nis talking about it. If one paid any attention to it, one would\\nnever get anything done--and it would be such a recreation for the\\nchildren. Juffrouw Karels ought to attend to her own business--and\\nwhen Gustave's birthday came, he might invite some \\\"young gentlemen.\\\"\\n\\nGustave's birthday came. \\\"Young gentlemen\\\" were to be invited,\\nand--Walter was among that select number.\\n\\nIt would lead me too far from the subject to enter upon an\\ninvestigation of the motives that prompted Gustave and Franz to invite\\ntheir former partner in the peppermint business. The list was made out\\nand approved by their mother; and as Juffrouw Pieterse felt flattered,\\nthere was no objection from her side. Walter must promise, of course,\\nto behave properly and be \\\"respectable,\\\" not to soil his clothes, not\\nto wrestle and tear his clothes, and many other things of a similar\\nnature. Juffrouw Pieterse added that it was a great favor on her part\\nto let him go, for such visits made a lot of work for her.\\n\\nYes, Walter was to make a visit! Eat, drink and enjoy himself under\\na strange roof. It was a great event in his life, and already he\\nwas becoming less jealous of the Jews, who went away so often, and\\nfinally never came back home at all.\\n\\nIt was midday now--that glorious midday. With indescribable dignity,\\nfor a boy, Walter stepped through the gate-way. \\\"A little to right--to\\nthe left, to the left again, then over a bridge, and then to the\\nright straight ahead. You can't miss it,\\\" Gustave had said. The name\\nof the garden was \\\"City Rest,\\\" so all Walter had to do was to \\\"ask,\\\"\\nand he would \\\"find it.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so it was.\\n\\nAnyone making a call or visit for the first time always arrives too\\nearly. So it was with Walter, who reached City Rest before any of the\\nother guests. But the boys received him cordially and presented him\\nto their mother, who said that Walter had a pretty face, if it were\\nonly not so pale.\\n\\nThe other playmates came then, and running and throwing began, in\\nthe customary boyish style. This was interrupted with waffles and\\nlemonade, which they \\\"must drink quite slowly,\\\" because they were\\n\\\"wet with perspiration.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the proud mother of the Hallemans was speaking of berries and\\nthe grossly slandered rainwater barrel, she might have mentioned\\nthe advantages of the leafy bower, where Betty was now sitting with\\na gentleman.\\n\\n\\\"Who is that?\\\" asked Walter of little Emma, who was playing with\\nthe boys.\\n\\n\\\"That? That's Betty's sweetheart.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that touching story of slender Cecilia we know that Walter already\\nhad his first love affair behind him; but still Emma's statement was\\nto him something new. Up to that time he had thought that a sweetheart\\nwas a girl to whom one gives slatepencils and bonbons. But she seemed\\nto be above such things. Walter saw immediately that he had not taken\\nthe right course with Cecilia; and all at once a desire came over\\nhim to know how a grown man treats a girl who is through school.\\n\\n\\\"Her sweetheart?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes--engag\\u00e9!\\\"\\n\\nThat word was too modern for Walter. If the reader is sharp he can\\ncalculate in what year that girl married the barber's apprentice. All\\nthat is necessary is to determine when that stupid engag\\u00e9 came into\\nuse in this sense in \\\"III. 7, a.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What did you say?\\\" asked Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Engag\\u00e9--they go together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, they're going to get married. Don't you know?\\\"\\n\\nWalter was ashamed not to know such a simple thing; and, as is often\\nthe case, he was ashamed of being ashamed.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, of course I know. I hadn't understood right\\nwell. Emma--will you marry me?\\\"\\n\\nFor the moment Emma was unable to accommodate him, as she was engag\\u00e9\\nwith her mother; but as soon as she was free she would consider\\nthe matter, and Walter would probably be favored. She looked at him\\nsweetly--and then the game called her to another part of the yard.\\n\\nLove is the instinct for unity--and the instinct for multiplicity. As\\neverywhere, nature is simple here in principle, but manifold in\\napplication. The love of a thief means: Come, we will go steal\\ntogether. The servant of the Word unites with his loved one in prayer\\nand psalm, etc., every animal after his kind.\\n\\nOr is this instinct to share, to be together, to be united at the\\nsame the instinct for the good?\\n\\nIn Walter's case it was, even though he himself did not know it. Had\\nhe not, in the name of Cecilia, liberated a bird that fluttered about\\nits narrow cage in distress? Of course Cecilia had laughed and asked\\nWalter if he was crazy. She did not know that there was any connection\\nbetween his sympathy for the poor little bird and the beating of his\\nheart when he scratched her name on the frozen window-pane in the\\nback room. Perhaps she would have understood if she had loved Walter;\\nbut that was impossible, because he still wore his jacket stuffed in\\nhis trousers.\\n\\nAt all events, it was not possible for him to think of anything bad\\nwhen he called \\\"Omicron.\\\" He had now forgotten Cecilia, and would\\nhave been greatly surprised if she had appeared in answer to his\\ncall. Little Emma would have come nearer meeting his requirements.\\n\\nWalter felt that he must know just how the young man was proceeding\\nwith Betty in the bower. He soon found an excuse to separate himself\\nfrom his companions; and then he heard all sorts of things that did\\nnot make him much wiser.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I said so too. In May----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, on account of the top story----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's annoying! And what does your mother say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hm--she says we must wait another year, that it isn't respectable\\nto get married in such a hurry--it's just as if----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Four years----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, four years. Louw and Anna have been engaged for seven.\\\"\\n\\nWalter was proud that he knew exactly what it all meant. To rent\\nan upper story together, preferably in May!--that was the way he\\nunderstood it.\\n\\n\\\"And do you get that press for the linen?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, mother wants to keep it. But if we will only wait a year she\\nwill give us another one--a small one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The big one would have been nicer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think so too, but she says young people don't need a big press. But\\nwhen my sister was married she got a big one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell them you want a big one too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's no use.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Try it. I won't marry without that big one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will make them----\\\"\\n\\nThis is a fair sample of what Walter overheard. He was dissatisfied\\nand slipped away and hid himself, lost in thought. He didn't even know\\nhimself what was the matter with him; but when Emma came and called\\nhim he looked as if he had been thinking of anything else but presses\\nand vacant flats, for in a tone at once joyous and fearful he cried:\\n\\n\\\"Could it be she--my little sister?\\\"\\n\\nIt was evening now, and the children were to continue their games\\nindoors. As the little party was tired, one of the grown-ups was\\ngoing to tell a story.\\n\\nJust what \\\"grown-up\\\" had been requisitioned to narrate the story of\\nParadise and Peri, I don't know. Anyway the story hardly harmonized\\nwith Betty's engagement and that love-obstructing clothes-press. But\\njust as Fortune is said to smile on everyone once in a lifetime, so,\\nin the midst of the flatness and insipidity of everyday life, it seems\\nthat something always happens which gives that one who lays hold of it\\nopportunity to lift himself above the ordinary and commonplace. To the\\ndrowning man a voice calls: \\\"Stretch out thy arms, thou canst swim.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"After Peri had begged long, but in vain, at the gates of paradise to\\nbe admitted to the land of the blessed, she brought at last, as the\\nmost beautiful thing in the world, the sigh of a repentant sinner;\\nand she found favor with the keeper of the gate on account of the\\nsacredness of the gift she had brought----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's play forfeits now!\\\" cried Gustave.\\n\\n\\\"Forfeits! Forfeits!\\\" everybody called out after him.\\n\\nAnd they played forfeits. Pawns were redeemed; and of course there\\nwas some kissing done. Riddles were given that nobody could guess;\\nand who ever knew must not tell--a usual condition in this game.\\n\\n\\\"Heavy, heavy hangs over your head; what shall the owner do to\\npossess it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stand on one leg for five minutes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let him jump over a straw--or recite a poem!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, a fable--la cigale, or something like that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes!\\\"\\n\\nIt was Walter's pawn.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know any fable,\\\" he said, embarrassed; \\\"and I don't know\\nFrench either.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will help you,\\\" cried Emma. \\\"Le pere, du pere----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's no fable! Go ahead, Walter!\\\"\\n\\nFor some of the party it was a joy that Walter knew no Fable and no\\nFrench. If it were only known how often one can do a kindness by being\\nstupid, perhaps many, out of love for humanity, would affect stupidity.\\n\\nBut Walter did not think of the pleasure of the others--which he\\ncould not have understood. He wept, and was angry at Master Pennewip,\\nwho had taught him no French and no fable.\\n\\n\\\"Forward, Walter, forward!\\\" insisted the holder of the pawn.\\n\\n\\\"It needn't be French. Just tell a fable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I don't know what a fable is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it's a story with animals.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, or with trees! Le ch\\u00eane un jour dit au roseau--don't you see,\\nyou can have one without animals.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, a fable is just a story--nothing else. You can have in it\\nanything you want to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it must rhyme!\\\"\\n\\nWalter was thinking about reciting his robber song, but fortunately\\nhe reconsidered the matter. That would have been scandalous in the\\nhome of the Hallemans, who were so particularly respectable.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" cried another, who was again wiser than all the rest, \\\"it needn't\\nrhyme. The cow gives milk--Jack saw the plums hanging--Prince William\\nthe First was a great thinker. Don't you see, Walter, it's as easy\\nas rolling off of a log. Go ahead and tell something, or else you\\nwon't get your pawn.\\\"\\n\\nWalter began.\\n\\n\\\"A little boy died once who was not allowed to go to heaven----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oho! That's the story of Peri. Tell something else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was going to change it,\\\" said Walter, embarrassed. \\\"And so the\\nlittle boy couldn't enter the heavenly gates, because he didn't know\\nFrench, and because he had sometimes been bad, and because he hadn't\\nlearned his lessons, and also because he--because he\\\"----I believe\\nWalter had something on the end of his tongue about his mother's\\nbox of savings, but he swallowed it, that he might not offend the\\nHallemans by any allusion to the peppermint business--\\\"because he\\nonce laughed during prayers. For it is certain, boys, that if you\\nlaugh during prayers you'll never get to heaven.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So--o-oo?\\\" asked several, conscious of their guilt.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, they can't go to heaven. Now the boy had had a sister, who died\\none year before him. He had loved her a lot, and when he died he began\\nto hunt for his sister right away. 'Who is your sister?' he was asked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who asked him that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Be still! Don't interrupt him. Let Walter tell his story!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know who asked that. The boy said that his little sister\\nhad on a blue dress and had dimples in her cheeks, and----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just like Emma!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, exactly like Emma. They told him that there was a little girl\\nin heaven that looked just like that. She had come the year before,\\nand had asked them to let her brother in, who would certainly inquire\\nafter her. But the boy could not go in. I have already said why.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Had the little girl always learned her lessons?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course! Don't you see she had? Let Walter go on with his story!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was sad that he could not get to see his sister any more. He felt\\nthat it hadn't really been worth the trouble to die. 'Oh, just let\\nme in!' he begged the gentleman at the door----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the gate!\\\" corrected several simultaneously, who, though untouched\\nby the sublimity of Walter's conception of death, were offended by the\\ncommonplaceness of the word door. But such things happen frequently.\\n\\n\\\"All right!\\\" said Walter. He was ashamed that he had offended against\\npropriety. \\\"The gentleman at the gate said, 'No!' and then the poor\\nboy returned to the earth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That won't do,\\\" cried the philosophical contingency, \\\"whoever is\\ndead remains dead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't interrupt him. Of course it's only a story!\\\"\\n\\nWalter continued: \\\"He returned to the earth and learned French. Then\\nhe appeared at the gate again and said, 'Oui, Monsieur!' but it did\\nno good; he was not admitted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think not; he ought to have said: 'j'aime, tu aimes.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know anything about that,\\\" Walter replied.\\n\\n\\\"Then he went to the earth again and learned his lessons till he\\ncould say them backwards. He did this for the keeper of the gate;\\nbut all this did no good; he was not allowed to go in.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course not,\\\" cried one of the wise ones, \\\"to get to heaven you\\nmust be confirmed. Had he been confirmed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. That's the reason it was so difficult. Then he tried something\\nelse. He said that he was engaged to his sister.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just like Betty,\\\" cried Emma.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, like Betty--and that he loved her and wanted to marry her. But\\nit was all of no use; they wouldn't let him into heaven.\\n\\n\\\"Finally he didn't dare go to the gate any more, for fear the keeper\\nwould get angry at him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then? What happened?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" Walter stuttered. \\\"I don't know what he ought to do\\nto get to heaven.\\\"\\n\\nWalter knew the rest of the story very well, but he couldn't put it\\ninto words. This was shown in a peculiar manner an hour later.\\n\\nOn the way home the party was almost run over by a wagon just as\\nthey were crossing a bridge. In the commotion Emma slipped under the\\nrailing and fell into the stream. Somebody screamed, and Walter sprang\\nafter her.\\n\\nIf he had died at that moment the keeper of the gate would hardly\\nhave turned him away because he didn't know French and had not been\\nconfirmed.\\n\\nWhen he was brought home, wet and dirty, Juffrouw Pieterse said that\\none ought not to tempt the Master, and that's what one did when one\\njumped into the water without being able to swim.\\n\\nBut I find that the man who can't swim is the very one to expect\\nsomething of the Master; for the man who can swim has some prospect\\nof helping himself.\\n\\nAnd Juffrouw Pieterse complained that there was \\\"always something\\nthe matter with that boy.\\\" There was something the matter with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse must have inherited something, for all at once the\\nPieterses moved to a more respectable neighborhood, and the daughters\\nno longer knew any of the girls that they used to sew with. Such things\\ndo happen in cases of inheritance, when one moves to a more select\\nquarter. Besides, there were other signs. They exerted themselves in\\ntrying to get Leentje to speak \\\"better Dutch.\\\" Stoffel was zealous\\nin teaching her, but Juffrouw Pieterse spoiled everything by her\\nbad example.\\n\\nWalter was now wearing a new jacket, with a small collar, such as\\ncabmen wore later. For him a jacket to stuff in the trousers was a\\nthing of the past. It \\\"looked so babyish,\\\" the young ladies said,\\nand was \\\"out of the question now when the boy can write poetry.\\\"\\n\\nThat Walter could write poetry was boasted of to everybody that\\nwould listen. Under the circumstances they really had no right to\\nreap any fame from Walter's robber song; but this only showed what an\\nimportant r\\u00f4le vanity plays in the world. Of course he himself never\\nheard anything of this; it was mentioned only when he was not present.\\n\\nThe image of Cecilia had disappeared from Walter's heart; and little\\nEmma was forgotten. Omicron must show her face in the stars from time\\nto time to remind the child of his love. And even when he looked at\\nthe evening sky and his soul was stirred by an inexpressible longing\\nafter the good, it was not so much that he was thinking of Omicron\\nas that he was moved by vague sweet memories. In the twelve years of\\nhis life there was a mythical prehistoric period which was difficult\\nto separate from the historical period.\\n\\nHe didn't know that he could write verses. He accepted it as a matter\\nof course that his robber song was very poor, and looked upon Klaasje\\nvan der Gracht with awe. It was from Juffrouw Laps he learned that\\nhe could write poetry; and it was an illumination for him.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps had an uncle whose birthday was coming the next week. She\\nhad paid the Pieterses a swell visit to ask if Walter wouldn't write\\nher a poem for the occasion. She would see that he got some bonbons.\\n\\n\\\"But Juffrouw Pieterse, you must tell him that it must be religious\\nand that my uncle is a widower. He must bring that in. I should like\\nfor it to be in the melody of the 103d psalm, for my uncle has that\\npsalm in his lyre.\\\"\\n\\nThe reader will note that she did not mean the lyre of Apollo. What\\nshe spoke of was a thing that turned, and made a screechy noise.\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse was going to speak with Walter about it when he came\\nfrom school, but first she had to consider the matter with Stoffel,\\nto decide whether it should be a request or a command, so that Walter\\nwould have no reason to be \\\"stuck-up.\\\" For that she could not endure\\nin a child.\\n\\n\\\"Walter, did you know your lesson?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, mother; I had to learn thirteen mountains in Asia, and I knew\\nonly nine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, look here, that won't do. I'm paying tuition for nothing. Do you\\nthink money grows on my back? I don't know what's to become of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know, either.\\\"\\n\\nAfter all, though, Walter was flattered by the commission to write\\na poem. Stoffel's and Juffrouw Pieterse's efforts to conceal their\\nreal opinion of his poetical talents had been useless. It was a\\npleasant surprise for the boy to learn that he was looked up to. He\\nhad always heard that he was worse than worthless, and that he would\\nnever amount to anything. It interested him now to hear the assurance\\nof his mother and Stoffel that the commission was only a punishment for\\nnot knowing the mountains in Asia. In a great rush Stoffel taught him\\nthe difference between \\\"masculine\\\" and \\\"feminine\\\" verses, explaining\\nthat these must alternate, that all must be of the same length, and\\nthat if at any time the boy was in doubt he would clear the matter up,\\netc., etc.\\n\\nWalter was delighted. He went to the back room, got a slate pencil\\nand began to write. It could hardly be called a success. \\\"A widower\\nof God\\\"--\\\"O God, a widower!\\\" That was as far as he got.\\n\\nHe gnawed on the pencil till he had pulverized it and worn out his\\nteeth, but it wouldn't go. He was continually being interrupted\\nby Stoffel's masculine and feminine verses. He had been too proud,\\nand now he was receiving his punishment. He began to believe that\\nhis mother was right when she said nothing would ever come of him.\\n\\nNor could Leentje help him. So he determined to make another attempt\\nto-morrow. Perhaps he could do better then. Leentje agreed with him.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Juffrouw Pieterse. \\\"But don't disgrace us\\nall. Remember, I told Juffrouw Laps you could do it; and the man's\\nbirthday comes Thursday week. So you haven't any too much time.\\\"\\n\\nWalter went to Ash Gate, found his bridge and began to weep bitterly.\\n\\n\\\"See what's the matter with that boy,\\\" he heard a woman saying to a\\ngirl fourteen or fifteen years old. \\\"Perhaps he has lost something.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you lost anything?\\\"\\n\\nWalter looked up, and was surprised; for he seemed to have seen that\\nface before. It reminded him of Fancy.\\n\\n\\\"Now, everything will be all right There you are; and I have been\\nhunting for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, but I just didn't know it. But I know it now. Tell me\\nright quick how to write the poem!\\\"\\n\\nThe girl, who was helping her mother place the linen on the grass for\\nbleaching, looked at Walter in astonishment. She hurried back to her\\nmother to say that she didn't know what was the matter with the boy,\\nbut that there was certainly something wrong. \\\"He looks as if he were\\nscared half to death,\\\" she decided.\\n\\nThen she ran and fetched water from the house near by and made Walter\\ndrink. He saw that he had made a mistake; but there was something in\\nthe manner of the girl that drew him to her irresistibly, even though\\nher name was only Femke. So the mother addressed her. And this name\\nreminded him of Fancy, which was something.\\n\\nFemke pointed to an inverted basket and told him to tell the cause of\\nhis trouble; and Walter did it as well as he could, while the mother\\nwas busy with the linen.\\n\\n\\\"Maybe I can help you,\\\" the mother said. \\\"I have a nephew who is\\na widower.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Juffrouw--but the poem? And there must be something about God\\nin it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. It's a long story. His wife was a niece of my\\nhusband's--you see we are Catholics, and she acted according to\\nher religion--put a stone on those cloths, Femke, or they'll blow\\naway--yes, bleaching is a job. You have no idea what a bother\\nit is--yes, she acted according to her religion; and that was\\nright. People that don't do that are not much. But he--draw that\\nshirt back a little, Femke. The sleeve is hanging in the ditch--but\\nhe didn't believe in it, and said it was all nonsense. But when she\\ndied, and he saw all that was done for her--it was Father Jansen who\\nwas there. Of course you know him--he always walks with a black cane,\\nbut he never lets it touch the ground----\\\"\\n\\nThe women looked at Walter questioningly. The poor boy sat on the\\nbasket, his elbows on his knees, his chin in his hands. He had listened\\nwith open mouth, wondering how he was going to apply it all to his\\npoem. Of Father Jansen and that cane which despised the ground he\\nhad never heard. This he had to confess.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it was Father Jansen who was there, and when my husband's nephew\\nsaw all that--don't spill any, Femke, or the mud will splatter so\\nbad--yes, when he saw that a human being doesn't die like an animal,\\nthen he was more respectful, and after that he observed Easter like\\nother people. And last year when he broke his leg--he's a dyer,\\nyou know--he drew thirteen stivers for nine weeks. And so I wanted\\nto tell you that there's a widower in our family. And now you must\\nget up, for I need the basket.\\\"\\n\\nWalter arose quickly, as if he feared he might seem to be trespassing;\\nand the woman went away, after having warned Femke to watch the linen\\nand call her if any bad boys should come along.\\n\\n\\\"Are you better now?\\\" Femke asked kindly.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes; but I don't see how I'm to use all that in my poem. You\\nmust remember that it has to rhyme, and the verses must be of the\\nsame length, and that they must be masculine and feminine; for my\\nbrother said so, and he's a school-teacher.\\\"\\n\\nFemke reflected, then all at once she cried, \\\"Do you know Latin?\\\" As\\nif Latin would help Walter.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" disconsolately.\\n\\n\\\"Well, it really makes no difference. It's in Dutch, too. Just watch\\nthe linen a minute.\\\"\\n\\nWalter promised, and Femke ran to the house.\\n\\nThen some boys came along throwing rocks. Walter, conscious of his\\nresponsibility, called to them to desist--or words to that effect. This\\nonly made them worse. They came closer, and, to worry Walter, began to\\nwalk over the linen. For him it was as if they were mistreating Femke,\\nand he charged on the miscreants. But it was two against one, and a\\nweaker one at that; so he would have soon been defeated if his lady had\\nnot returned quickly. She rescued him and drove off his assailants; and\\nwhen she saw that his lip was bleeding she gave him a kiss. The boy's\\nheart trembled; all at once his soul was lifted to an unfamiliar level;\\nand for the first time in weeks he felt again that princely nature\\nthat had given Leentje such a fright. His eyes shone, and the boy,\\nwho but a moment ago did not know how he was to write some rhymes,\\nwas filled with the feelings and emotions that make poets of men.\\n\\n\\\"O Fancy, Fancy, to die for thee--to die with such a kiss on the lips!\\\"\\n\\nIt hurt him to think that the boys were gone. If there had been ten\\nof them he would have had courage for the unequal fight.\\n\\nAnd Femke, who had never heard of poetical overflows, understood him\\nimmediately, for she was a pure, innocent girl. She felt Walter's\\nchivalry, and knew that she was the lady to reward it.\\n\\n\\\"You are a dear sweet boy,\\\" she said, taking his head between her\\nhands and kissing him again, and again--as if she had done something\\nof this kind before. But such was not the case.\\n\\n\\\"And now you must read the verses in the little book. Maybe it will\\nhelp you to write for your aunt----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She isn't my aunt,\\\" Walter said, \\\"but of course I will look through\\nthe book.\\\"\\n\\nHe laid it on the railing of the bridge and began to read. Femke,\\nwho was taller than he, had put one arm around his neck, while with\\nthe other hand she was pointing out what he should read.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see?\\\" she said, \\\"the lines are the same length.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but they don't rhyme.\\\" And Walter read:\\n\\n\\n    Mother most pure,\\n    Mother undefiled,\\n    Virgin most powerful,\\n    Virgin most merciful,\\n    Virgin most faithful,\\n    Spiritual vessel,\\n    Vessel of honor,\\n    Vessel of singular devotion,\\n    Mystical rose,\\n    Tower of David,\\n    Tower of Ivory,\\n    Gate of Heaven----\\n\\n\\n\\\"But, Femke, how am I to use that for my poem? I don't understand\\nany of it.\\\"\\n\\nFemke didn't understand much of it either. She had been reading the\\nbook every day for the past four or five years, and she had always been\\nsatisfied with her comprehension of it. But now she saw that she was\\nas ignorant about it as Walter. She was ashamed and closed the book.\\n\\n\\\"But don't you know what Faith is?\\\" she asked, as if this defect\\nmight account for the general ignorance of both.\\n\\n\\\"Not that way,\\\" Walter replied. \\\"I learned it another way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you believe in Jesus, don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes. That's God's son. But I didn't learn anything about vessels\\nand towers. Do they belong to faith?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, certainly! But you know the holy virgin, Maria!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So? Maria? No, I don't.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Purgatory?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know anything about it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And confession?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you do then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you mean, Femke?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean to be saved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" Walter replied. \\\"You mean, to get to heaven?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, certainly. That's the point. And you can't do that without the\\nholy virgin and such a book. Shall I teach you the creed, Walter? Then\\nwe'll be together in heaven.\\\"\\n\\nThat pleased Walter, and Femke and Walter began:\\n\\n\\\"God created the world----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What did he do before that, Femke?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. But the people were made wicked by a snake; then the\\nPope pronounced a curse upon the snake, for the Pope lives in Rome,\\nyou know. And then Jesus was crucified to make the people good\\nagain. That was a long time ago.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know,\\\" Walter said, \\\"Jesus changed the number of the year. At\\nhis birth he began at nought.\\\"\\n\\nFemke didn't know again. In this way each supplemented the knowledge\\nof the other; and Walter was proud that he knew something about the\\ncreed, even if Femke did think it the wrong creed.\\n\\n\\\"And so Jesus made the people good again, and if you will pray out\\nof such a book you will be saved. Do you understand, Walter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not quite. What is an ivory tower?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, that's only a name for the virgin. It's as if you were to call\\nthe pastor father. Now you understand.\\\"\\n\\nFemke hunted for another illustration.\\n\\n\\\"You have a mother; what do you call her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, I call her mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Correct. What do the other people call her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They call her Juffrouw Pieterse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just so. When we call the holy virgin 'ivory tower' it's just like\\ncalling your mother Juffrouw Pieterse. Ivory gate means that to get\\nto heaven we must go through the holy virgin. That's the main thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Femke, what is a virgin?\\\"\\n\\nFemke blushed.\\n\\n\\\"That is anybody that has never had a child.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me?\\\" asked Walter in astonishment.\\n\\n\\\"No, child, it must be a girl!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you a virgin?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course!\\\"\\n\\nFemke spoke the unvarnished truth.\\n\\n\\\"Of course--because I'm not married.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But Maria was married--and Jesus was her child.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, that's where the holiness comes in,\\\" replied Femke. \\\"And for that\\nreason she is called the ivory gate. Do you understand now, Walter?\\\"\\n\\nWalter did not understand; but he asked permission to take the book\\nhome with him, that he might study it. That, however, was not possible,\\nas Femke needed the book every day. Walter consoled himself easily,\\nfor not for anything in the world would he have endangered Femke's\\nsalvation. Femke asked him to come again. She would be glad to tell\\nhim all she knew about the matter; and, if both should get tangled up,\\nshe would ask Father Jansen about it. And then Walter would soon be\\nas wise as she was.\\n\\nWalter withdrew; i. e., after he had kissed Femke heartily. This\\nmeeting with her, the mysterious book, salvation, the fight with the\\nboys--all these things would run through his mind whenever he tried\\nto think of the poem. It seemed to him that there was some connection\\nbetween them.\\n\\nWhen he got home he turned through Stoffel's books, hoping to find\\nsomething about holy vessels, ivory towers, and immaculate virgins. But\\nthey were all school books, and gave information about everything\\nelse but salvation. Walter was crushed, but he was still searching.\\n\\n\\\"Master Pennewip had a father and mother; and certainly old Pennewip,\\ntoo, who slaughtered hogs; and the one before him, too--but who was the\\nfirst Pennewip? And who slaughtered the hogs before old Pennewip? And\\nbefore there were any hogs, what did butchers do? And----\\\"\\n\\nI will know all of that some day, Walter thought. If he could have only\\nquieted himself so well about his poem! If that were only written, he\\nthought, then he would clear up the lost causes of everything. In the\\nmeanwhile he dreamed of Femke, of her blue eyes, her friendliness,\\nher soft lips--and of her voice, when she said, \\\"You are a dear,\\nsweet boy.\\\"\\n\\nCould it be that she is Omicron? he thought.\\n\\nAnd thus the child dreamed, dreamed; and, just as in the development\\nof humanity, in his life was working a three-fold impulse, towards\\nlove, knowledge, and conflict.\\n\\n\\\"But Walter, don't you read any books at home about the creed?\\\"\\n\\nThus Femke questioned her little friend the next day, as he sat on\\nher basket again.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but they're not pretty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you know anything by heart?\\\"\\n\\nWalter repeated a stanza of a reformed church hymn. This found no\\nfavor with Femke; though she liked his reciting.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you read anything else?\\\"\\n\\nWalter reflected: he flew through Stoffel's library--works of the\\nPoetical Society, Geology by Ippel, On Orthography, Regulations\\nfor the Fire-Watch, Story of Joseph by Hulshoff, Brave Henry, Jacob\\nAmong His Children, Sermons by Hellendoorn, A Catechism by the same,\\nHoorn's Song-book.\\n\\nHe felt that all of this would not prove very imposing for\\nFemke. Finally:\\n\\n\\\"I do know something, but it isn't about faith and the creed. It's\\nabout Glorioso.\\\"\\n\\nFemke promised to listen, and he began to relate the story. At first\\nhe spoke mechanically, using all the \\\"and then's\\\": but soon he put\\nhimself into the soul of the hero and told the story better than he\\nhad read it in the greasy book. At every deed of Glorioso he would\\nspring from the basket and act the part of that hero in a way that\\nmade Femke's blood run cold. Still, how magnificent she found it! And\\nwhen at last he was through, a spark from his peculiar but sincere\\nenthusiasm had fallen into her heart, which like his beat with delight\\nover the beauty of what she had heard. Her cheeks glowed--really,\\nif a Treckschent had started to Italy at that moment I believe she\\nwould have gone along, in order to take part in so much danger and\\nadventure--and love. The nicest thing about the story was that it\\nshowed how firm such a robber is in the faith.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you know another story?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Walter. \\\"One more. It's in a little book--a calendar,\\nI believe.\\\"\\n\\nAnd he related the story of Telasco and Kusco and the beautiful\\nAztalpa.\\n\\nTelasco and Kusco, sons of the King of the Sun-worshipers, were\\ntwins; and so both were equally near the throne. They loved each other\\ndevotedly; so which would give way for the other? Which of the two was\\nto become Inca? Funeral pyres were built, one for each, and prayers\\nwere offered to the sun that one of the piles might be ignited. But the\\nsun did not light either. He ordered that Aztalpa, the sister, should\\nchoose one. That one to whom she offered her hand should inherit the\\nthrone and the empire. But the princess could not decide, for she\\nloved them both dearly and both equally. It was then decided that\\nboth should go out hunting on a certain morning, and that the one who\\nkilled the first doe should become king. Telasco had red arrows, Kusco\\nblue. The morning came. The brothers were lying in a thicket as the\\ndeer approached. Both fired, and both missed. Then they swore mutually\\nnot to miss intentionally the next time. They kept the oath, and two\\ndeer fell; but Telasco had shot one of Kusco's arrows, and Kusco one\\nof Telasco's. Telasco then proposed that Aztalpa should be killed,\\nto avoid any discord in the empire; and in the other world both would\\nenjoy the same place in her affections. All agreed to this; but when\\nthe fatal day came, Aztalpa fell on her knees before Telasco and begged\\nthat she might receive her death at the hand of Kusco. Telasco cried:\\n\\\"Aztalpa, you have chosen!\\\" All bowed down before Kusco; and when\\nthey looked for Telasco he had disappeared. He was never seen again.\\n\\nOften Femke interrupted with questions, for there was much that was\\nstrange and wonderful to her; but she was charmed with the story and\\nshared all of Walter's enthusiasm.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you, though, Walter, if that girl had known what Telasco was\\nup to she wouldn't have done it. But the story is beautiful. I wonder\\nif such things really happen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was far from here, Femke, and a long time ago. That's just the\\nway it was in the book. But now I must go home, for I haven't a stiver\\nto pay the gate-keeper if I come in after eight. Oh, Femke--if I were\\nonly through with that poetry business.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It will turn out all right. Just think of Telasco. He had a difficult\\ntask, too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No! I will think of the girl. Good-evening, Femke----\\\"\\n\\nWalter received the hearty kiss that his story had earned him, and\\ndreaming of Aztalpa, who was guarding the linen, he passed through\\nthe Ash Gate and turned towards home. The moon shone so brightly that\\nhe was annoyed not to have been able to remain with Femke. How much\\nbetter, he thought, could he have told his story by moonlight! But\\nhe didn't have the price--a stiver.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n\\nThe moon paused on the sky, as if she were weary of her lonely\\nlot. Was she grieved because ungrateful humanity had fallen asleep\\nand was ignoring her?--or because of the light borrowed from her\\nfor thousands of years, and none returned? She poured forth her\\nsorrow in heart-breaking noiseless elegies till the night-wind was\\nmoved to pity. Whish! he went through the trees; and the leaves\\ndanced. Crash! he went over the roof; and the tiles flew away, and\\nchimneys bowed meekly; and over the walls and ditches the sawmills\\ndanced with the logs they were to saw. There a girl sat sleeping. Could\\nit be Femke? The linen danced about her to the music of the wind, the\\nshirts making graceful bows and extending their sleeves. Nightcaps,\\ndickeys and drawers danced the minuet; stockings, skirts, collars,\\nhandkerchiefs waltzed thicker and thicker around the sleeping girl. Her\\ncurls began to flutter--a smile, a sigh, and she sprang to her feet. A\\nwhirlwind caught her up and----\\n\\n\\\"O, heavens, Femke, Femke!\\\" and Walter grasped at the apparition that\\nwas being borne away towards the moon in a cloud of stockings, socks,\\ndrawers, shirts and collars.\\n\\n\\\"Mother! Walter's pinching me,\\\" cried Laurens, the printer's\\napprentice; and Juffrouw Pieterse groaned, that those boys couldn't\\neven keep quiet at night.\\n\\nThe \\\"House of Pieterse\\\" gathered at Walter's bed. There was the noble\\nmother of the family enveloped in a venerable jacket that fell in broad\\nfolds over a black woolen skirt. There was Trudie, with her stupid blue\\neyes; and Myntje and Pietje--but what am I talking about? In the new\\nhome Trudie had become Gertrude, like a morganatic princess in Hessia;\\nand Myntje was now Mina, but preferred to be called Mine, as that\\nsounded more Frenchy. But her stupid face remained unchanged. Pietje\\nwas now Pietro. Stoffel had said that was a very swell name.\\n\\nStoffel, too, had now appeared on the scene, to the great astonishment\\nof his mother, who expected so much of him. This fine sense of\\npropriety had been developed in the new home.\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter with you, boy?\\\" cried everybody at once.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, mother, Femke--Femke!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The boy is foolish.\\\" That was the unanimous verdict of the family.\\n\\nAnd they were not altogether wrong. Walter was delirious.\\n\\n\\\"They are carrying her away--around and around--Daughter of the Sun,\\ndecide--here is Telasco--thou shalt die, Aztalpa--Femke, stay,\\nstay, I will watch the clothes--I will shoot the doe--a widower\\nof God--together through the ivory gate--there she is again--stay,\\nOmicron!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ought we to call in a preacher?\\\" asked Juffrouw Pieterse\\nhesitatingly. She didn't know whether praying was needed or a\\nwhipping--or both.\\n\\nAnd now, perhaps for the first time in his life, Stoffel expressed a\\nsensible thought: \\\"Mother, we ought to have a doctor. Walter is sick.\\\"\\n\\nWalter had nervous fever. It was fortunate for him that a doctor was\\ncalled in, and still more fortunate that it was a man who understood\\nWalter's mental troubles. He exerted a most wholesome influence on\\nthe boy; though this came later, as at first he could only treat\\nthe disease.\\n\\nOn Juffrouw Pieterse, too, he had a good influence. To her great\\nastonishment, he explained to her that children ought not to be\\npacked together in a bed as if they were superfluous pieces of\\nfurniture being thrown aside; that air, light, play, enjoyment,\\nexercise are all necessary for the development of body and soul;\\nthat whipping does no good, and that she had better dispense with her\\n\\\"divine worship.\\\" He told her of other things she had never heard of;\\nand she listened willingly, for the doctor----\\n\\n\\\"Ah, dear Juffrouw Laps, you must manage to be here when he comes. He\\nwrites the prescriptions with a gold pen; and his coachman wears a\\nbrown bear-skin cape.\\\"\\n\\nThat gold pen and the bear-skin cape! Ah, if everyone who preaches\\ntruth could only dress up his coachman so swell! But alas, alas--I\\nknow a great many people who love the truth, and they have no coachman\\nat all--not to mention the bear-skin.\\n\\nAnd gold pens often get into the wrong hands.\\n\\n\\\"I just wanted Juffrouw Zipperman to come sometime when the doctor's\\nhere. Run and tell her, Gertrude, that I said Walter was sick,\\nand say that we have lunch about twelve. He came about that time\\nyesterday. And Leentje, you go to the grocer's--we need salt--have\\nsomething to say about it--it's not just to be gossiping, you know--I\\ndespise gossip--but I would like to know if the people have noticed\\nit. And you, Pietro, remember that you are to give me a clean cap\\nwhen he comes--for the doctor is such an elegant gentleman, and such\\na doctor! And all that he said--I drank it all in. Mina, you mustn't\\nstare at him again like that; it's not proper. But I'm curious to\\nknow if the people at the grocer's have seen him!\\\"\\n\\nI shouldn't like to be severe on her; but it seems to me that Juffrouw\\nPieterse was gradually beginning to take pleasure in Walter's illness.\\n\\nThere is something swell in having such a carriage standing before\\none's door.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps had come: \\\"But dear Juffrouw Pieterse, what am I to do\\nabout my uncle? You are invited; and I have told him that there will\\nbe a poem.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very bad, Juffrouw Laps. You can see though that that poor worm\\ncan't write the poem. What about Stoffel? Why not ask him to write it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's all right with me. Just so it's a poem; otherwise I'm disgraced.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel was requested to take Walter's place, but he raised objections\\nat once.\\n\\n\\\"You don't know what that would mean, mother. I would lose the respect\\nof the boys. For anyone working with youth, respect is the main thing;\\nand such a poem----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the boys at school need not know it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the man would tell somebody and then--you don't understand it. At\\nthe Diaconate school there was a fellow who wrote verses; and what\\nhas become of him? He went to India, mother, and he still owes me for\\nhalf a bottle of ink. That's the way it goes, mother. For me to write\\nsuch a poem? No, no, mother--for a boy like Walter it's all right;\\nbut when one is already a teacher!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Master Pennewip?\\\" cried Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\n\\\"The very man!\\\" cried Stoffel, as if this supported his former\\nargument. \\\"A happy thought! Master Pennewip will do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've read a poem by him, Stoffel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes. And you've read a poem by him. That's because--but how\\nshall I explain that to you, Juffrouw Laps? You know that in teaching\\nthere are all kinds of things. Take Geography, for example. I will just\\nmention one fact: Madrid is on the Manganares. Understand, mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes, Stoffel. That's just as if you were to say----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Amsterdam on the Y. Exactly so. And then there are many, many more\\nthings, Juffrouw Laps. You have no idea how much there is of it. A\\ngrocer mixes sugar with something else. He must calculate exactly\\nwhat he must get for a pound in order not to lose money. Think of\\nit! And then you have partnership, and breakage, and the verbs--but\\nI must go before those rascals break everything.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel returned to school earlier than usual, without having\\ndiminished Juffrouw Laps's difficulties very much. That poor woman\\ncould not comprehend how geography and Madrid and the grocer and\\npartnerships made it impossible for Stoffel to write verses. Juffrouw\\nPieterse smoothed the matter over as well as she could and sent\\nJuffrouw Laps to Master Pennewip.\\n\\nThat gentleman was alarmed when he saw the angry \\\"sucking animal,\\\"\\nbut he quieted down as soon as he heard the object of her visit.\\n\\n\\\"To what class does your uncle belong, Juffrouw?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, to the class--you mean the mussel-shells and eggs?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, Juffrouw, I mean on which rung of the ladder is he--how high\\nup. I repeat it, on what rung--it's a figure, Juffrouw--on what rung\\nof the social ladder?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the grain business? Is that what you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is not sufficient, Juffrouw Laps. One may be in the grain\\nbusiness as a pastry cook, a baker, a retailer, a wholesaler, or as a\\nbroker; and all these vocations have their peculiar sub-divisions. Take\\nJoseph in Egypt, for example. This man of God, whom some place in\\nthe class of patriarchs, while others claim--but let that be as it\\nmay. It is certain that Joseph bought corn and was on the topmost\\nrung of the ladder, for we read in Genesis, chapter 41----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed, he rode in Pharaoh's carriage, and he wore a white silk\\ncoat. My uncle is an agent, and my father was the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So-o-oo?  Agent!  That's something Moses doesn't mention, and I\\ndon't know in what class----\\\" He spoke slowly, puzzling over his words.\\n\\n\\\"Besides, my uncle is a widower.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, there we have the difference! We read that Joseph wooed Asnath,\\nthe daughter of Potiphar; but nowhere do we read that his spouse was\\nalready dead when he went into the corn business. Therefore, Juffrouw\\nLaps, if it is your earnest desire to have a pious poem written on\\nyour uncle, I advise you to go to my pupil, Klaasje van der Gracht.\\\"\\n\\nHe explained to her where that prodigy might be found.\\n\\nAgain I must beg pardon if my criticism of Pennewip is too severe; but\\nhe gave me reasons enough to harbor ugly suspicions against him. I am\\nconvinced that he would have written that poem for Juffrouw Laps if\\nher uncle had received a white silk coat from the king, or had ever\\ndriven through The Hague in a royal carriage. But to sing an agent in\\nverse! He would leave that to the genius of \\\"the flying tea-kettle\\\"\\nin the Peperstraat. That was not nice of Pennewip. Was that uncle\\nto blame because his brothers never threw him into a well? or sold\\nhim into Egypt? Or because he couldn't interpret dreams? Or because\\ncleverness is not rewarded to-day with rings, white coats, carriages\\nand high official position?\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps footed it over to the Peperstraat, where she made\\nthe acquaintance of the elder van der Gracht. The old gentleman\\nfelt flattered.\\n\\nHe was most gracious, and assured the Juffrouw that the poem should\\nbe written that very evening. Klaasje could bring it over the next\\nmorning and repeat it to Juffrouw Laps, and if it were found worthy\\nas an expression of her feelings toward her uncle, then Klaasje was\\nto be invited to be present on that evening. The father assured her\\nthat Klaasje would wear a white stand-up collar.\\n\\n\\\"Just like Joseph,\\\" said the Juffrouw. \\\"Everything is in the Bible.\\\"\\n\\nWhen she got home she read the forty-first chapter of Genesis,\\ntrying to find the relation of Klaasje's apotheosis to Joseph's\\nexaltation. That night she dreamed she had a mantle in her hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\n\\nIt was the afternoon of the day on which Juffrouw Laps sought out\\nKlaasje van der Gracht, and Walter was lying in bed, still weak but\\nno longer delirious. The doctor had ordered rest and quiet. The child\\ncounted the flowers in the curtain, and, in his imagination tried\\nto arrange them in some other order. He allowed them to jump over\\none another, or flow into one another. He saw in them faces, forms,\\narmies, clouds--and all were alive and moving. It was tiresome, but\\nhe couldn't do anything else. If he turned his face toward the wall\\nit was still worse. The hieroglyphic scratches on the wall told him\\nall sorts of things that he didn't need to know and overwhelmed him\\nwith unnecessary impressions. He closed his eyes; but still he found\\nno rest. It seemed to him as if he were being swept away to take part\\nin that entertainment that the night-wind gave the moon. Everything\\nwas turning round and round, taking him along. He seized his head in\\nboth hands, as if he would stop his imagination by main strength; but\\nit was useless. The curtains, the cords, the wall, the flowers, the\\ndance, the whirlwind that tore Femke away--his efforts to hold her----\\n\\nThe boy burst into tears. He knew that it was all imagination; he\\nknew that he was sick; he knew that chimneys don't dance, and that\\ngirls are not blown to the moon; and yet----\\n\\nWeeping he called Femke's name softly, not loud enough to be heard\\nby the others, but loud enough to relieve his own depression.\\n\\n\\\"What's that?\\\" he cried suddenly. \\\"Does she answer? Is that\\nimagination, too?\\\"\\n\\nActually, Walter heard his name called, and it was Femke's voice!\\n\\n\\\"I must know whether I'm dreaming, or not,\\\" he said, and straightened\\nhimself up in bed. \\\"That is a red flower, that is a black one, I am\\nWalter, Laurens is a printer's apprentice--everything is all right;\\nand I'm not dreaming.\\\"\\n\\nHe leaned out of bed and listened again, his mouth and eyes as wide\\nopen as he could get them, as if the senses of taste and sight were\\ngoing to reinforce that of hearing.\\n\\n\\\"O, God! Femke's voice! Yes, yes, it is Femke!\\\" He jumped out of bed,\\nran out the door, and half ran, half fell down the steps.\\n\\nTo return to Femke for a little while. She had expected Walter at\\nthe bridge the next day after the story of the sun-worshipers. At\\nfirst she thought that Walter was waiting till he could borrow from\\nStoffel the book with the picture showing Aztalpa embracing the two\\nbrothers. She wanted to see Walter with the picture; now she would have\\nbeen satisfied with him without the picture. It couldn't be the boy's\\nperson, she thought--such a child!--but he did recite so well. Perhaps\\nin the heart of the girl Walter and his recitals had already coalesced.\\n\\n\\\"Put the clothes in the sun,\\\" cried her mother; and Femke translated\\nthat: Sun--Peru--Aztalpa--Kusco--Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Run those fighters away; they'll throw dirt on the clothes.\\\"\\n\\nFemke dreamed: Courageously fighting against the enemies of the\\ncountry--the noblest tribe of the Incas--Telasco--Walter.\\n\\nEverything seemed to be calling for Walter; but he did not come.\\n\\nThe first day she was sad; the second, impatient; the third, restless.\\n\\n\\\"Mother, I'm going to see what's become of the little boy who was\\ngoing to write a poem.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do, my child!\\\" said the mother. \\\"Do you think you will find him?\\\"\\n\\nFemke nodded; but her nod was not convincing. She did not know where\\nWalter lived and was afraid to say so. It took courage to start out to\\ntrace the child when she didn't know where he lived; and this courage\\nshe wished to conceal. And why? Just timidity incident to the tender\\nfeelings. Sometimes we conceal the good and boast of the bad.\\n\\nThe girl dressed herself as prettily as she could and put all her\\nmoney in her pocket. It was only a few stivers. She hurried through\\nAsh Gate and inquired where the shop was that lent books. Thus she\\ncame directly to the Hartenstraat. She simply retraced the steps of\\nour hero, when he made that first sally with Glorioso.\\n\\nLess timid than Walter--Femke was older, and had had more experience\\nwith men--she asked the gruff fellow in a business-like way for\\n\\\"the book about the countess with the long train or her dress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What? What's the title?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" Femke said. \\\"It's about a robber--and the Pope's\\nmentioned in it, too. I am hunting for the boy who read the book. I\\nwanted to ask where he lives--I will pay you for your trouble.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you think I'm a fool? Am I here to hunt for boys?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, M'neer, I will pay you,\\\" the girl said, and laid the money on\\nthe counter.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, get on! What do I know about your boy?\\\"\\n\\nFemke got angry now.\\n\\n\\\"I haven't done anything, and you can't run me off like that. No,\\nyou can't. If you don't want to tell me, you needn't to. You are an\\nunaccommodating fellow!\\\"\\n\\nShe was going to leave, when it occurred to her to ask, \\\"And won't\\nyou lend me a book, either?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you can get a book. What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That book about the robber and Amalia,\\\" said Femke. She felt now that\\nshe was a \\\"customer,\\\" and oh, how proud she had become all at once!\\n\\n\\\"I don't know anything about such a book. Do you mean Rinaldo\\nRinaldini?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. Is there more than one robber book? Just call over the names of\\nthem for me.\\\"\\n\\nThis was said with an air of importance that was not without its effect\\non the shopman. He pulled down the catalogue, and soon he came to\\n\\\"Glorioso.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's it, that's it!\\\" cried Femke, delighted.\\n\\n\\\"But you must deposit a forfeit,\\\" the man said, as he mounted the\\nladder to get that precious book.\\n\\n\\\"No, no, I don't want the book at all. I only want to know where the\\nboy lives who read it. I will pay you gladly,\\\" and she pointed to\\nher money.\\n\\n\\\"That isn't necessary,\\\" he said. \\\"I don't mind accommodating you when\\nyou ask me politely.\\\"\\n\\nHe looked in the register and found the name Femke had mentioned, with\\nthe address. He showed it to her, and was even going to explain to her\\nthe best way to get there; but Femke was already out the door. The\\nfellow had difficulty in overtaking her to return the money she had\\nforgotten on the counter.\\n\\nWhen she reached the address given, Femke learned that the Pieterses\\nhad moved to a \\\"sweller neighborhood.\\\" It was quite a distance away;\\nbut Femke was not deterred by that.\\n\\nOnce at the Pieterses', she was received by the young ladies with a\\nrough, \\\"What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Juffrouw, I wanted to ask about Walter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who are you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am Femke, Juffrouw, and my mother is a wash-woman. I would like\\nto know if Walter is all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What have you got to do with Walter?\\\" asked Juffrouw Pieterse,\\nwho had heard the commotion and came down.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Juffrouw, don't be angry--I wanted to know; and my mother knows\\nthat I've come to ask. Walter told me about Telasco, and the girl\\nthat was to die--oh, Juffrouw, tell me if he's sick! I cannot sleep\\ntill I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's none of your business. Go, I tell you! I don't want strange\\npeople standing around the door.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For mercy's sake, Juffrouw!\\\" cried the girl, wringing her hands.\\n\\n\\\"The girl's crazy. Put her out, Trudie, and slam the door!\\\"\\n\\nTrudie began to execute the order. Myntje and Pietje got ready to\\nhelp her; but the child clung to the balustrade and held her ground.\\n\\n\\\"Throw her out! The impudent thing!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Juffrouw, I'm not impudent. I will go. Just tell me whether\\nWalter is sick. Tell me, and I will go right now. Just tell me if\\nhe's sick--if, if he's going--to die.\\\"\\n\\nThe poor child began to weep. Anybody else but those Pieterse women\\nwould have been touched at the sight. They were too far up the ladder.\\n\\nPlainer people, or nobler people would have understood Femke. Feeling,\\nsympathy, is like the money in a gambling-place. It doesn't come\\nto everybody. There wenches and countesses sit side by side; merely\\nrespectable people, who sell shoes made in Paris, are not there.\\n\\n\\\"I won't go!\\\" cried Femke. \\\"Oh, God! I won't go! I will know whether\\nthat child is sick!\\\"\\n\\nA door was heard opening above; and Walter came in sight. He tumbled\\ndown the steps and fell unconscious at Femke's feet.\\n\\n\\\"That boy!\\\" groaned the old lady, while the girls stood as if\\ntransfixed. Femke picked Walter up and carried him upstairs. His\\nbed was pointed out to her, and she placed him in it. No one had the\\ncourage to run her away when she took a chair by the bedside. If at\\nthis moment the rights of the Pieterses and Femke had been voted upon,\\nall the votes would have gone to Femke.\\n\\nShe wept, and stammered \\\"Don't be angry, Juffrouw; but I couldn't\\nsleep for thinking of him.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n\\nThe evening of the birthday party came. All of the Pieterses went,\\nleaving Walter to be taken care of by Leentje.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps was doing the honors.\\n\\n\\\"A strange state of affairs,\\\" said the birthday uncle. \\\"And what did\\nshe want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, goodness, M'neer, I don't know myself. I've told Gertrude a\\nhundred times that it's too much for me. Just imagine to yourself--such\\na thing issuing commands in my house! I told Mina to pitch her out. And\\nPietro said----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You ought to have seen me get hold of her,\\\" croaked that brave young\\nwoman, showing a blue place on her hand. From this it might have been\\ninferred that Femke had had hold of Pietro.\\n\\n\\\"Just wait till she comes again,\\\" cried Gertrude, \\\"and I will attend\\nto her!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what will I do for her?\\\" said Mina significantly.\\n\\nEvery one of them was ready for the fray. That is often the case. If\\nthe vote had been taken now on moral worth, Femke would have been\\ndefeated.\\n\\n\\\"A common girl, M'neer!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Worse than common!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did you get rid of her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, it wasn't easy. I said----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, mother, I said----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, it was I!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it was I!\\\"\\n\\nEach one of them had said something. Everyone wanted to play the\\nleading r\\u00f4le in the interesting drama.\\n\\n\\\"I would like to know where the young Mr. van der Gracht is,\\\" said\\nJuffrouw Laps. \\\"Yes, uncle, it's a surprise----\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse did not like to be interrupted when she had something\\nto tell.\\n\\n\\\"And so we said--what did we say, Gertrude?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother, I said it was a disgrace.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I said so, too. Then that thing asked for cold water, and\\nwhen we didn't get it quick enough for her, she ran and fetched it\\nherself--just as if she were at home! She wet a cloth and put it on\\nWalter's head. I was amazed at her insolence. When the child came to\\nshe gave him a kiss! Think of it--and all of us standing there!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" cried the three daughters, \\\"think of it--and us standing there!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then she sat down in front of the bed again and talked to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where can the young Mr. van der Gracht be!\\\" sighed Juffrouw\\nLaps. \\\"It's only because we have a little surprise, uncle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And finally she went away like a princess!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Exactly like a princess,\\\" testified the girls; and they did not know\\nthat they were telling the truth.\\n\\n\\\"And she told Walter she would come again. But I just want to see\\nher do it!\\\"\\n\\nThe door-bell rang. Juffrouw Laps arose; and the catechist van der\\nGracht with his son walked into the room. Juffrouw Pieterse didn't\\nlike this; she felt that the star of her narration would pale in the\\nlight of the poem Klaasje had brought with him. And even without a\\npoem: such dignity, such a carriage, such manners, such a voice!\\n\\n\\\"Mynheer and Juffrouwen, may God bless you all this evening! This\\nis my son Klaas, of whom you have heard, I suppose. He's too close\\nkin to me for me to praise him; but you understand--when it's the\\nfather--well, all blessings come from above.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, uncle, it will be a surprise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed, Juffrouw, a beautiful surprise. I congratulate this\\ngentleman on the happy return of his natal day. It puts me in the\\nmood of the psalmist--and I thank God--for Mynheer, everything comes\\nfrom above, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take a seat. I thank you,\\\" said the host, who understood that he\\nhad been congratulated. \\\"It's cold out, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, a little cool; hardly cold. It's just what we call cool, you\\nunderstand. The Master gives us weather as he sees fit; and for that\\nreason I say cool. Everything comes from above.\\\"\\n\\nTo this last statement all assented in audible sighs and thought\\nthemselves pious. What would have happened to him if some poor devil\\nhad announced to them that some things come from below?\\n\\n\\\"And now, uncle, what do you say? Shall we begin with the surprise?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go ahead, niece; what have you got?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it's only a trifle, Mynheer,\\\" put in the catechist. \\\"My son is\\na poet. I don't praise him, because he's too close kin to me; but\\nhe's a clever fellow--I can say that without bragging--for everything\\ncomes from above. No, I won't praise him--praise is for the Master\\nalone. But he's a clever fellow.\\\"\\n\\nThe poet Klaas looked conscious, and sat toying with the bottom button\\non his vest. He looked poetical all over.\\n\\n\\\"And so, Mynheer, without bragging--get it out, my son. As a father,\\nMynheer, I may say that he's a clever fellow; for in the Bible----\\\"\\n\\nKlaasje drew a piece of paper from his pocket.\\n\\n\\\"In the Bible there is really nothing said about widowers--the Master\\nhas his own good reasons for it--but what does the boy do? He takes\\nthe hint and writes a whole poem on widows.\\\"\\n\\nKlaasje laid the paper on the table.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I dare say, he has brought into it all the widows mentioned in\\nthe Bible.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see it's a surprise. I told you so,\\\" said Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\n\\\"Read it, Klaasje! There are seventy, Mynheer, seventy widows. Read,\\nmy boy.\\\"\\n\\nKlaas pulled at his clothes, arranged his cuffs and began:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"The widows that in the Bible appear,\\n    I've brought together in this poem here,\\n    For the birthday that we celebrate\\n    Of him who sadly lost his mate,\\n    Exalting always the Master of Love,\\n    For all that we have comes from above.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"That's the prologue,\\\" explained the father.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's the prologue. Now I will read:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Genesis, 38, verse 11, it is said:\\n    At her father-in-law's must the widow have her bed.\\n    Exodus, 20, 22, it is penned:\\n    Widows and orphans thou shalt not offend.\\n    Two verses further he threatens, wrathful and grim\\n    To make widows of all the women that anger him.\\n    Leviticus, 21, verse 14, thou read'st\\n    That a widow won't do for the wife of a priest.\\n    A chapter further, one verse less, we have read,\\n    That a childless widow must eat her father's bread.\\n    From Numbers, 30, verse 10, we clearly infer,\\n    That a widow's vow is sufficient for her.\\\"\\n\\n\\nIn this style he continued glibly, without any interruption; but when\\nhe came to:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Second Samuel, 20, 3, very clearly outlines,\\n    That as widows must live David's concubines----\\\"\\n\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse became restless and had to have an explanation.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Juffrouw, concubines,\\\" said van der Gracht senior. \\\"You see\\nthe boy has brought in everything relating to widows.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The verses are not the same length,\\\" Stoffel complained; and there\\nis no alternation of masculine and feminine lines.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You may be right, Stoffel, for you are a school-teacher; but that's\\nimmaterial to me. These--these con--what shall I say----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Juffrouw Pieterse, you ought not to mock at it,\\\" cried Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" said the catechist, \\\"all blessings come from above. Go\\nahead, Klaas!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I will not hear such things--on account of my daughters!\\\"\\n\\nThe girls were examining their finger nails, and looked pre\\u00ebminently\\nrespectable.\\n\\n\\\"Go ahead, Klaas!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I had known that this was going to happen, I would have left my\\ndaughters at home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Juffrouw, it's in the Bible. You're not opposed to the Bible,\\nare you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, but I refuse to hear anything that isn't respectable. My\\nhusband----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your husband sold shoes. I know it, Juffrouw, but you're not going\\nto turn against----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not going to do anything against the Bible, but I will not endure\\nsuch coarseness. Come, Gertrude, come, children!\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse was climbing the ladder of respectability. Moving\\nout of a side street into one of the principal avenues, giving the\\nchildren French names, calling in a doctor whose coachman wears\\nfurs--that is what lifts us up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n\\nWalter's illness now took a favorable turn. As soon as he was\\nstrong enough to leave his bed, the whole family noticed that he\\nhad grown. All remarked about it and called each other's attention to\\nit. No one was better convinced of the fact than Juffrouw Pieterse; for\\n\\\"that boy\\\" had \\\"outgrown all of his clothes,\\\" and it would not be easy\\n\\\"to fit him out respectably again.\\\" So much interesting notoriety and\\nrespectability had been reaped from Walter's illness that it was only\\nnatural that his convalescence should be turned to the best account.\\n\\nThe child would sit and fill in the colors in pictures. The doctor\\nhad presented him the pictures and a box of colors. The latter,\\nso Stoffel said, were the genuine English article.\\n\\nOh, such pictures!\\n\\nWalter was interested especially by pictures from the opera and the\\ntragedy. There were pictures from Macbeth, Othello, Lear, Hamlet,\\nfrom \\\"The Magic Flute,\\\" \\\"The Barber of Seville,\\\" \\\"Der Freisch\\u00fctz,\\\"\\nand from still a few more--each one always more romantic than the\\nlast. In selecting suitable colors for his heroes and heroines, Walter\\nhad the advice of the entire family, including Leentje. Usually there\\nwas disagreement, but that only made the matter more important. In\\nonly two details were they agreed: faces and hands were to have\\nflesh-color, and lips were to be painted red. It had always been\\nthat way; otherwise, why was it called flesh-color? On account of\\nthis arrangement Hamlet came off rather badly, receiving a much more\\nanimated countenance than was suited to his melancholy.\\n\\n\\\"I wish I knew what the dolls mean,\\\" said Walter. He was talking\\nabout his pictures.\\n\\n\\\"It's only necessary to ask Stoffel,\\\" his mother replied. \\\"Wait till\\nhe comes from school.\\\"\\n\\nWalter asked him. Stoffel--there are more such people in the\\nworld--would never admit that he did not know a thing; and he always\\nknew how to appear knowing.\\n\\n\\\"What the dolls mean? Well, you see--those are, so to say, the pictures\\nof various persons. There, for instance, the one with a crown on his\\nhead--that is a king.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I told you Stoffel could explain them,\\\" corroborated his mother.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but I should have liked to know what king, and what he did.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well! There it is at the bottom. You can read it, can't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Macbeth?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. It's Macbeth, a famous king of ancient times.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that one there with a sword in his hand?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Also a king, or a general, or a hero, or something of the\\nkind--somebody that wants to fight. Perhaps David, or Saul, or\\nAlexander the Great. That's not to be taken so exactly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the lady with the flowers? She seems to be tearing them up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That one? Show her to me: Ophelia. Yes, that's Ophelia. Don't\\nyou know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Why does she throw the leaves on the ground?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why? why? The questions you do ask!\\\"\\n\\nHere the mother came to the rescue of her eldest son.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Walter, you mustn't ask more questions than anybody can answer.\\\"\\n\\nWalter did not ask any more questions, but he determined to get to\\nthe bottom of the matter at the first opportunity. His imagination\\nroamed over immeasurable domains--such an insatiate conqueror was\\nthe little emperor Walter in his night-jacket!\\n\\nHe associated the heroes of his pictures with the doctor, who had been\\nso friendly to him, and with his immortal Glorioso. The Peruvian story,\\ntoo, furnished a few subjects for his empire. He married Telasco to\\nJuliet; and the priests of the sun got their rights again. Master\\nPennewip received a new wig, but of gold-colored threads, on the\\nmodel of the straw crown of a certain King Lear. Persons that he\\ncould see from the window were numbered among his subjects. He had\\nto do something; and this foreign material was preferable to that in\\nhis immediate surroundings. Even Lady Macbeth, who was washing her\\nhands and not looking particularly pleasing, seemed to him to be of\\na higher order than his mother or Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\nIn fact, for him those pictures were the greatest things in\\nthe world. He was carried away with the crowns, diadems, plumes,\\niron gratings over the faces, with the swords and the daggers with\\ncross-hilts to swear on--with the trains and puff-sleeves and girdles\\nwith pendents of gold--and the pages. All this had nothing in common\\nwith his everyday surroundings. How is it possible, he thought, that\\nanyone who has such beautiful pictures should sell them? The doctor\\nmust have inherited them!\\n\\nEven if he had known that Lady Macbeth was the personification of\\ncrime, it would still have seemed to him a profanation to bring her\\ninto contact with the plebeian commonness around him.\\n\\nAll at once something in Ophelia's form reminded him of Femke. She\\ntoo could stand that way, plucking the petals from the flowers and\\nstrewing them on the ground.\\n\\nHe had dim recollections of what had happened, and occasionally he\\nwould ask indifferently about \\\"that girl.\\\" He was afraid to speak\\nher name before Gertrude, Mina, and Pietro. He was always answered in\\ntones that showed him that there was no room for his romance there;\\nbut he promised himself to visit her as soon as he got up.\\n\\n\\\"When you're better you must go to see the doctor and thank him\\nfor curing you--but thank God first; and then you can show him what\\nyou've painted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course, mother! I will give her the Prince of Denmark--I mean him,\\nthe doctor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But be careful not to soil it; and don't forget that the ghost of the\\nold knight must be very pale. Stoffel said so--because it's a ghost,\\nyou see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother, I'll make it white.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good. And you'll make the lady there yellow?\\\" pointing with a\\nknitting-needle to Ophelia.\\n\\n\\\"No, no,\\\" cried Walter quickly, \\\"she was blue!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She was? Who was?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I only mean that I have so much yellow already, and I wanted to make\\nher--this one--Ophelia--I wanted to make her blue. That one washing\\nher hands can stay yellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So far as I'm concerned,\\\" the mother said, \\\"but don't soil it!\\\"\\n\\nStoffel, in the meantime, had got on the track of those pictures. He\\nwas slick and had an inquiring mind. One of his colleagues at school,\\nwho was in some way connected with the stage, told him that such\\ncostume-pictures were of great value to players. He also told him\\nother things about these pictures and about the play in general.\\n\\nIt was fortunate for Walter that Stoffel brought this knowledge\\nhome with him. Even to-day there are people who find something\\nimmoral in the words \\\"Theatre\\\" and \\\"Player\\\"; but at that time it was\\nstill worse. The satisfaction, however, of imparting knowledge and\\nappearing wise put Stoffel in an attitude of mind on this occasion\\nthat ordinarily would have been irreconcilable with that narrowness\\nwhich with him took the place of conscience.\\n\\n\\\"You see, mother, there are comedies and comedies. Some are sad,\\nsome funny. Some are all nonsense, and there's nothing to be learned\\nfrom them; but there are comedies so sad that the people wail when\\nthey see them--even respectable people!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it possible!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and then there are others where there's music and singing. They\\nare nice, and moral too. They are called operas; and people who\\nare entirely respectable go there. You see, mother, there's nothing\\nbad about it; and we ought not to be so narrow. The old Greeks had\\ncomedies, and our professors still study them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it possible!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Walter's pictures are from real comedies; but I can't tell all the\\ndetails now. I will only say there are good comedies.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must tell Juffrouw Laps. She always says----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what does she know about it? She never saw a comedy in her life.\\\"\\n\\nThat was the truth; but it was just as true of the Pieterse\\nfamily--with the exception of Leentje.\\n\\nOne afternoon Leentje had complained of a terrible headache and\\nhad left off sewing and gone out. Later it was learned that she had\\nnot spent the evening with her mother; and then there was a perfect\\nstorm. But Leentje would not say where she had been that night. \\\"That\\nnight\\\" was Juffrouw Pieterse's expression, though she knew that the\\ngirl was at home by eleven o'clock. Leentje betrayed nothing. She\\nhad promised the dressmaker next door not to say anything; for the\\ndressmaker had to be very careful, because her husband was a hypocrite.\\n\\nIn Leentje's work-box was found a mutilated program; and then one day\\nshe began to sing a song she had never sung before--\\\"I'm full of honor,\\nI'm full of honor; oh, yes, I'm a man of honor!\\\"\\n\\nAnd then it was all out! She had been to the Elandstraat and had seen\\nthe famous Ivan Gras in a comedy!\\n\\nLeentje began to cry and was going to promise never to do so again,\\nwhen, to her amazement, she was told that there was nothing wrong in\\nit, and that even the greatest professors went to see comedies.\\n\\nAnd now she must tell them about it.\\n\\nIt was \\\"The Child of Love,\\\" by Kotzebue, that had greeted her\\nastonished eyes.\\n\\n\\\"There was music, Juffrouw, and they played beautifully; and then the\\ncurtain went up, and there was a great forest, and a woman wept under\\na tree. There was a Baron who made her son a prisoner, because he was\\na hunter--but he spoke so nice, and his mother, too. The Baron said\\nhe was master on his place, and that he would punish such thieves. He\\nwas in a great rage. And then the mother said--no, somebody else\\ncame and said--but then the curtain went down. The dressmaker bought\\nwaffles that were being passed around, and we drank chocolate. The\\ndressmaker said that every day wasn't a feast day. A man sat behind us\\nand explained everything and took our cups when they were empty. Then\\nthe band played, 'Pretty girls and pretty flowers.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shame!\\\" cried the three young ladies. For it was a common street song.\\n\\n\\\"And then the curtain went up again of its own accord; but the\\ngentleman behind us said somebody raised it--perhaps the 'Child of\\nLove' himself, for he was not in prison when the curtain was down. The\\ndressmaker gave him a peppermint-drop, and he said: 'Watch the stage,\\nJuffrouw, for you have paid to see it.' It cost twelve stivers,\\nwithout the waffles and chocolate. Then the Baron said--but I can't\\ntell it all exactly as it was. I will only say that the old woman\\nwept all the time, and she could not be reconciled, because she was so\\nunhappy. You see, Juffrouw, the child of love was her own child; and it\\nwas also the Baron's child of love. That was bad--because it was just\\na child of love, you see; and that is always bad. He had no papers,\\nno credentials; nor the mother, either. And he was to die because he\\nhad hunted. Oh, it was beautiful, Juffrouw! And then the curtain went\\ndown again and we ate another waffle. The gentleman behind us said it\\nwas well that they gave plays with prison scenes in them. There were\\nso many bad people in the hall, such as pickpockets and the like,\\nand this would be a warning for them. The dressmaker was going to\\noffer him another mint-drop, when she saw that her box was gone. It\\nwas silver. The gentleman said of course some pickpocket had taken it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was the pickpocket!\\\" exclaimed several.\\n\\nLeentje was indignant at the idea.\\n\\n\\\"No, no! Don't say that; it's a sin. He was a very respectable\\ngentleman, and addressed me as Juffrouw, just as he did the\\ndressmaker. He tried to find the thief. He asked where the Juffrouw\\nlived, and said that if he found the box he would bring it to her. He\\nwore a fancy vest--no, no, no. Don't say that of him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, tell some more about the child of love.\\\" All were interested.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, the music was so nice! And a gentleman showed them with a stick\\nhow to play.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But tell us about the comedy!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is not so easy. It was very beautiful. It must be seen; it can't\\nbe told. The Baron saw that the hunter in prison was his own son;\\nbecause a long time before, you see, that is--formerly, he had been\\nacquainted with--you understand----\\\"\\n\\nPoor Leentje turned as red as fire, and left her audience in a\\ntemporary suspense.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he had known the old woman formerly, and then they were good\\nfriends, and were often together--I will just tell it that way--and\\nthey were to marry, but something came between them; and so--and--for\\nthat reason the comedy was called the 'Child of Love.'\\\"\\n\\nWalter listened with as much interest as the others; but he was less\\naffected than the girls, who sat quietly staring into space. Stoffel\\nfelt called upon to say something.\\n\\n\\\"That's it! He abused her chastity--that's the way it's spoken of--and\\nshe was left to bear the disgrace. The youth of to-day cannot be\\nwarned enough against this. How often have I told the boys at school!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen, Walter, and pay attention to what Stoffel says!\\\"\\n\\nEncouraged by the approval of his mother, Stoffel continued.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother, virtue must be revered. That is God's will; and what God\\ndoes is well done. Of all sins sensual pleasure is--a very great sin,\\nbecause it is forbidden; and because all sins are punished, either\\nin this world or in the next.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you hear, Walter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here, or in the next world, mother! Innocent pleasure, yes; but\\nsensual pleasure--it is forbidden! It loosens all the ties of human\\nsociety. You see that such a comedy can be very fine. Only you must\\nunderstand it properly--that's the idea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what did the Baron do then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Juffrouw, what shall I say! He talked a whole lot to the old\\nwoman, and was very sad because he had--away back there--because\\nhe had----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Seduced her,\\\" added Stoffel, seeing that Leentje couldn't find the\\nword. \\\"That's what it's called.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's what she said, too; and he promised never to do it\\nagain. And then he told the child of love always to follow the path\\nof virtue, and that he would marry the old woman. She was satisfied\\nwith the arrangement.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose so,\\\" cried the three girls in a breath. \\\"She will be a\\nrich baroness!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Leentje, \\\"she became a great lady. And then the child of\\nlove fell on the Baron's neck; and they played 'Bridal Wreath.' The\\n'Child of Love' became a hussar and sang, 'I'm full of honor, I'm\\nfull of honor; Oh, I'm a man of honor!' I don't know what became of\\nthe old Baron. And then we went home; but the dressmaker took no more\\npleasure in the play now, because her silver box was gone. I don't\\nknow whether the gentleman ever brought it to her, or not.\\\"\\n\\nThe play was out.\\n\\nThe girls thought: \\\"Baroness!\\\"\\n\\nStoffel was thinking: \\\"Virtue!\\\"\\n\\nThe mother's thoughts ran: \\\"Twelve stivers for a ticket, and waffles\\nand chocolate extra!\\\"\\n\\nWalter was saying to himself: \\\"A hunter! A whole year in the forest,\\nin the great forest, and alone. I'd like to do it, too.\\\"\\n\\nHe took up his brush and looked at Ophelia: \\\"To be alone in the great\\nforest with--Femke!\\\"\\n\\nBut the theatre question was far from being settled. Leentje had to\\nclear up many doubtful points yet. For instance, Pietro wanted to\\nknow how old the woman was when the Baron finally married her. Leentje\\nthought she must have been about sixty.\\n\\nAlso Juffrouw Laps had to express her opinion. She declared that she\\nwas opposed to everything \\\"worldly,\\\" and insisted that Walter be sent\\nto church.\\n\\nLater she got into a big dispute over the theatre with Master\\nPennewip, whom Stoffel had brought in to reinforce his position. He\\nhad brought with him \\\"Floris the Fifth,\\\" that powerful comedy by the\\nnoble Bilderdyk. With many declensions and conjugations and remarks\\non rhyme and metre, he explained, firstly, that \\\"Floris the Fifth\\\"\\nwas a play from which much could be learned; and, secondly, that the\\ntheatre was something very moral and thoroughly respectable.\\n\\nTo be sure, he failed to convince Juffrouw Laps. Nor was Walter\\ngreatly impressed by that masterpiece, despite the fact that there\\nwere three deaths in it. He much preferred the beautiful story of\\nGlorioso, or the Peruvian story--or even Little Red Riding Hood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n\\nWalter had been to church: that was now behind him. Stoffel thought\\nthe pastor had preached a beautiful sermon, and said that \\\"in a way\\nall he said could be accepted.\\\" He hoped that it would \\\"bear fruit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the mother, \\\"and he mustn't tear his new breeches\\nagain. They cost too much hard work for that.\\\"\\n\\nAs a matter of fact the \\\"hard work\\\" done in the Pieterse family\\nmight be regarded as a negligible quantity. There was the necessary\\nhousework, and the usual complaining--or boasting, if you will--but\\nthis was to be expected.\\n\\nThat Walter had postponed his visit to go to church was a result of\\nthe frightful threats of Juffrouw Laps. She cited Second Chronicles\\nxvi. 12, and in the face of this text the Pieterses were not able\\nsuccessfully to defend their new and more liberal position. Juffrouw\\nPieterse could only say that the Bible was not to be interpreted that\\nway, as if everything in it applied to a given individual.\\n\\nBut Juffrouw Laps stuck to it, that if one has faith and grace one\\nmay come through all right; whereupon Juffrouw Pieterse expressed\\nher willingness at all times to take advice.\\n\\n\\\"Those are the essential things; through them we are saved! And--send\\nhim to me the first of the week. Or he can come Sunday, but after\\nchurch. Then he can tell me about the sermon, even if the pastors\\nare--but what does a child know about it!\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps didn't think much of pastors. She held that people\\nwith grace in their hearts can understand God's word without Greek\\nand Latin.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Sunday after church. I will count upon it.\\\" And in order to\\nmake her invitation more insistent she mentioned certain sweets that\\nshe usually served her guests at that time.\\n\\nSupposing that Juffrouw Laps was really anxious for Walter to come,\\nwe must admit that she showed deep knowledge of boy-nature.\\n\\nAs for Walter, he was afraid to be alone with this pious lady. For\\nhim she was the living embodiment of all the plagues that are made\\nuse of in the Old Testament to convert rebellious tribes to the true\\nfaith. For instance, thunder and lightning, pestilence, abysses,\\nboils, flaming swords, etc.\\n\\nIf he had had the courage he would have asked her just to deposit\\nthe promised dainties somewhere outside of her flat. He would find\\nthem then. But he didn't have the courage.\\n\\n\\\"And why didn't you go?\\\" asked the mother when Stoffel's enthusiasm\\nover the sermon had begun to die down.\\n\\nWalter said he had a pain in his stomach, which children always have\\nwhen they want to bridge over disagreeable duties. With a better\\nunderstanding between the parents and children this disease would be\\nless frequent.\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe you have any pain in your stomach,\\\" declared the\\nmother. \\\"It's only because you're a bad child and never do what you're\\ntold to do.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel agreed with her; and then a council of war was held. Walter\\nwas condemned to go to Juffrouw Laps's at once; and he went.\\n\\nExpecting some terrible ordeal, he was greatly embarrassed and confused\\nby the show of friendliness with which he was received.\\n\\n\\\"And you did come, my dear boy! But you are so late! Church has been\\nout a long time. See what I have for you, expressly for you!\\\"\\n\\nShe thrust him into a chair at the table and shoved all sorts of\\nsweets over to him. Walter's embarrassment increased; and he felt\\neven less at ease when she began to stroke him and call him pet names.\\n\\n\\\"Now, tell me about the sermon,\\\" she said, when the child tried\\nto escape the tenderness and affection to which he was not\\naccustomed. \\\"What did the pastor say?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The text----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But that's all right--afterwards, when your mouth is empty. You must\\neat a few cakes first. Nobody can do everything at once. There is\\nchocolate; and you're to have a little dram, too. I've always said\\nthat you are a nice boy; but they're forever plaguing you so. But\\nyou're not eating enough; do just as if you were at home.\\\"\\n\\nFor Walter that was not the right expression. At home!\\n\\nHis first surprise over Walter began to be possessed by a feeling of\\nfear. Why, he could not have told to save him.\\n\\nSuddenly he got up and declared that his mother had told him not to\\nstay long.\\n\\nThere wasn't a word of truth in it. Juffrouw Laps protested, but\\nWalter held his ground. Despite all of that kindness Walter was able\\nto escape from the enemy.\\n\\nPromising \\\"to come back soon\\\" he ran down the steps and into the\\nstreet.\\n\\nAn indescribable feeling of freedom regained thrilled through him. He\\nhad escaped. It was incomprehensible even to him. Never had he been\\nreceived so kindly, so cordially; never had he been treated in a\\nmanner approaching this. But why his antipathy? When he left she\\nwas going to kiss him, but he managed to dodge her. Why? He didn't\\nknow. But it made him shudder to think of it.\\n\\nShould he go home now? What excuse could he give for coming back\\nso soon?\\n\\nInvoluntarily he bent his steps toward Ash Gate. It was not his\\nintention to visit Femke--not at all, really not! For he didn't have\\nhis Ophelia with him--proof conclusive that when he left home he had\\nnot thought of Femke.\\n\\nAnd when he came in sight of his mills on the Buitensingel--oh,\\nthey were silent! Was there no wind? Or were they observing Sunday?\\n\\nThe Buitensingel was full of people taking a Sunday stroll. Walter\\nfollowed the small stream, which led him towards Femke's house. Soon he\\nstood before the low enclosure; but he did not dare to go in. Why? He\\nput the blame on the absent Ophelia.\\n\\n\\\"If I only had that picture here I'd certainly go in!\\\"\\n\\nThat is questionable. Even with the picture he would have probably\\nbeen just as shy. He didn't know what he ought to say--or, better,\\nwhether he could say anything, or not. He reflected. Suppose Femke's\\nmother should ask, \\\"Did you want anything?\\\"\\n\\nWe--yes, the \\\"gentle reader\\\" and I--we should have known what to\\nanswer. I wonder if our wisdom would have been wiser than the stupidity\\nof the child, who stood irresolute and hesitating before the fence?\\n\\nHe stood staring at the house, his mouth wide open. His knees trembled,\\nhis heart fluttered, his tongue was dry.\\n\\nA small column of smoke curling up from the chimney aroused him. What\\nif a fire should break out! Then he would have to go in. He would\\nrescue her, and carry her away in his arms--far, far away--to the end\\nof the world, or at least outside of the town! Just anywhere where\\nthe people wear red velvet and green silk, where the gentlemen carry\\nbig swords and the ladies wear long trains. They would be so becoming\\nto Femke. And she should ride horseback, and he would follow her--no,\\nhe would ride by her side, with a falcon on his hand!\\n\\nIf a fire should break out!\\n\\nBut Walter saw that the house was in no danger. This smoke came from\\nthe kitchen. He noticed other houses in the neighborhood where cooking\\nseemed to be going on, and everywhere the chimneys were bearing witness\\nto activities below which were presumably similar to those of Femke.\\n\\nFinally a crowd of fellows came along who had evidently been stopping\\nat one of those establishments where \\\"refreshments\\\" are served. They\\nhad been greatly refreshed, and in their exuberance of freshness,\\nso to say, they crowded Walter away from the fence and took him along\\nwith them for a little way.\\n\\nHe was easily reconciled to this; for why, he thought, should he\\nstand there and watch the smoke? There wasn't going to be any fire;\\nand then he didn't have Ophelia with him.\\n\\nBut to-morrow! To-morrow he would bring that picture with him! And\\nthen he wouldn't stand at the fence like a baby.\\n\\nHe felt ashamed when he thought of his friends in their gay colors,\\nor in armor, with plumes and swords. Those kings and knights and\\npages--they had been courageous, otherwise they never would have\\nreceived such high orders and distinctions. Unless there were some\\nchange, he felt that he would never be pictured like that.\\n\\nHowever, he expected that such a change would come--without doubt,\\nsurely, certainly, truly! The further he went, the more determined\\nhe became to go in the next day and put on a bold front and say:\\n\\\"Good-day, Juffrouw, how do you do?\\\"\\n\\nIt was more difficult for him to decide what he would say to Femke.\\n\\nHe made up various little speeches in the manner of Floris the\\nFifth. In case Femke shouldn't like them he was going to say, \\\"Why,\\nthat is from our greatest poet.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then he would ask her to explain a lot of mysterious words\\nin Floris that he hadn't understood--for instance, \\\"fast fellow,\\\"\\n\\\"coverture,\\\" \\\"chastity,\\\" and others.\\n\\nWalter's development was determined by his desire to know things. His\\nfeeling for Femke, which was hardly real love, was subordinated to\\nhis thirst for knowledge. He knew that he couldn't get much from her,\\nespecially book-learning; but it was a pleasure merely to discuss\\nthings with her, even if she knew nothing about them.\\n\\nHe was curious to know all that she might have to tell him, or to ask\\nhim; for no doubt she too had been saving up her impressions for her\\nfirst friend. But, alas! he was not so certain of her friendship! True,\\nwhen he was sick she had asked about him; but perhaps she was just\\npassing by, and thought how easy it would be to ring the bell and ask,\\n\\\"How is Walter?\\\"\\n\\nStill it had taken courage to do it. What would Mungo Park have said\\nif he had seen him hesitating before the gate! Walter knew that wasn't\\nthe way to conquer the world.\\n\\nAnd if anybody had asked Mungo Park: \\\"What do you want in Africa?\\\"\\n\\nWell, he would have answered. Such a traveller in such a book is\\nnever embarrassed.\\n\\nThen Walter began to address all sorts of remarks to negro kings\\nthat he had conquered with lance and sword. All the women kissed his\\nhand as he rode by on his bay, with fiery red caparison. He inquired\\npatronizingly after those good girls who had nursed him in his illness,\\n\\\"because the strange white man was far from mother and sisters and\\nhad no home.\\\" He would reward them princely.\\n\\nIn all this conquered land Walter was king and Femke was--queen! How\\nmagnificent the big red velvet cloak would look on her--and the\\ngold crown!\\n\\nConquering continents was easy. He was scarcely thirteen; and yet\\nhe was afraid that somebody might get ahead of him while he was\\nbeing detained by the treacherous Pennewip with declensions and\\nconjugations. And, then there were still more things to learn before\\none could be king, even of a small country. Pocket-change would have\\nto be increased too, for, with all possible economy, six doits a week\\nwere insufficient. The Hallemans--well, they had more; but fortunately\\nthey were not thinking of Africa. For the present he was not afraid\\nof any competition from that quarter; but other children, nearer the\\n\\\"grown-up\\\" stage, might get the idea in their heads! And then, what\\nwould he do to keep his mother from guessing when he made his trips\\ninto the \\\"interior\\\" longer, and stayed out later than was allowed by\\nthe regulations of the Pieterse household?\\n\\nIt was a difficult matter, but he would manage it.\\n\\nAll that might happen to him and Femke in Africa would be read\\nafterwards in pretty little books with colored pictures. He already\\nsaw himself sitting on a throne, and Femke by his side. She was not\\nproud; she was willing for everybody to know--all those kneeling\\nbefore her--that she had been a poor wash-girl. She had become queen\\nbecause Walter had loved her; and now they needn't kneel any more.\\n\\nOn special occasions--well, of course, that was different; for\\ninstance, when his mother and Stoffel came to visit him. They should\\nsee how all the people honored him--and Femke whom they had treated so\\nbadly. But once would be enough; then he would forgive them everything\\nand build them a big house with water-barrels and wash-tubs. For\\nPennewip he would build a big schoolhouse, with desks and ink-bottles\\nand copy-books and wall maps of Europe and tables of the new weights\\nand measures. Then the old master could give instruction from early\\nin the morning till late at night--or even all night.\\n\\nHe was just puzzling over how he was going to reconcile Master\\nPennewip and the dusky young African to one another when Leentje\\nopened the door.\\n\\nWithout noticing it he had got home and rung the\\ndoor-bell. Unsuspectingly he fell into an environment quite different\\nfrom that in which he had moved for the last half hour. He scarcely\\nunderstood what his mother meant when she asked him how the visit\\nturned out, and whether Juffrouw Laps was satisfied with his report\\non the sermon.\\n\\nSermon? Laps? He was unprepared for such an examination. He stammered\\nout a sort of miscellaneous and irrelevant jumble of words, but\\nfortunately containing nothing about Africa.\\n\\nIt now developed that in the meantime there had been a sudden change\\nin certain details of religious belief.\\n\\n\\\"You see, mother?\\\" said Stoffel. \\\"Just as I've always said, it\\nwould take a lawyer to explain anything to suit her. She always\\nknows better----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's so,\\\" answered the mother. \\\"She's cracked or crazy. Now,\\njust tell me, Stoffel, if anyone can expect such a child to remember\\neverything a preacher says. I can't do it myself; and you can't do it,\\neither. Master Pennewip can't do it. I tell you, nobody can do it. And\\nto require that of such a child! She just wants to play the professor;\\nthat's the reason she does it.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel was of the same opinion. Encouraged by his sympathy the mother\\nbecame eloquent.\\n\\n\\\"I would like to know what she's thinking about; or if she thinks\\nshe's a pastor. With all her biblical quotations! And then to torment\\na child hardly out of a sick bed--it's a disgrace. You don't need to\\ngo to her. What business have you got with her? I tell you----\\\"\\n\\nHere it occurred to her that she herself had compelled Walter to go,\\nand she interrupted this line of thought to scold Walter and tell him\\nto get out of his Sunday breeches. Her dissatisfaction with herself\\nexpressed itself further in a funeral oration on Walter's last suit,\\nwhich had cost so much \\\"hard work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then to let that child sit there for an hour without anything\\nto eat or drink! She would----\\\"\\n\\nWalter's feeling for justice couldn't let that pass. He assured them\\nthat on the contrary--and then that excessive kindness got in his way\\nagain. In his confusion he went into all the details of the chocolate.\\n\\n\\\"Well! Why didn't you say so at once? But it's all the same. I was\\ngoing to add that she ought to have given you something to eat. That's\\nthe way such folks are--always grumbling about others and they won't\\nsee themselves. I believe in grace too, and when I have my housework\\ndone I like to hear the Scripture read--but to be everlastingly and\\neternally prating about it? No, that isn't religion. What do you say,\\nStoffel? One must work part of the time. Walter! aren't you going\\nto pull off those new breeches? I've told him a dozen times. Trudie,\\ngive him his old ones!\\\"\\n\\nWalter changed his breeches; but he promised himself that in Africa\\nhe would wear Sunday breeches every day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\n\\nThe next day Walter rang the doctor's door-bell. His heart was in a\\nflutter, for the doctor lived in an imposing house. He was admitted\\nand, after he had been announced, was told just to come upstairs.\\n\\nThe maid conducted Walter to the \\\"study,\\\" where the doctor was busy\\nperforming one of his paternal duties: he was teaching his children.\\n\\nThere were three. A boy, somewhat older than Walter, sat alone in one\\ncorner writing at a small table. The other two, a boy of Walter's\\nage and a girl that seemed to be a few years younger, stood before\\nthe table behind which the doctor was sitting. On the table stood a\\nlarge globe, evidently the subject of discussion. This became clear\\nto Walter later, for, as far as he knew, he had never seen such a\\nlarge ball. He didn't know that there was any other way to explain\\nthe location of countries except by means of maps. Thus he noticed\\nin the room all sorts of things that he didn't understand till later.\\n\\nWhen the maid opened the door of the room he heard the voices of\\nthe children, and also that of the father. He even heard laughter;\\nbut when he walked in all became as still as death. The two children\\nat the table stood like soldiers. There was something so comical in\\ntheir attitude that Walter could have laughed at them if he hadn't\\nbeen so embarrassed. Even the girl had a touch of official earnestness\\nin her face more striking than he had seen it in older people, even\\nat church. While the doctor was welcoming Walter and offering him\\na chair, the boy stood with hands clapped down on the seams of his\\ntrousers as if he expected someone to say, \\\"Right about--face!\\\" or,\\n\\\"Forward, column right, march!\\\"\\n\\nThe larger boy in the corner had only looked up once, but with\\nthat peculiarly hostile expression which distinguishes man from\\nother animals--to the disadvantage of the former. It is noticeable\\nespecially in children--sometimes in women.\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad to see you, my boy. It was nice of you to come. What have\\nyou there?\\\"--then he turned to the little soldiers.\\n\\n\\\"Remind me afterward to tell you at dinner something about Olivier\\nvan Noort. William, you can think of it, can't you?\\\"\\n\\nWalter squinted at his Lady Macbeth, and was so embarrassed that he\\nwas helpless to present it to the doctor. The room was so magnificent;\\nand the furnishings--the big cases full of books! His picture seemed\\nso common and ugly that, if he could have done so, he would have\\nswallowed it.\\n\\nAt home they had taught him how he must stand and sit and speak;\\nand now he stood there, as awkward as a cow, stammering and\\nstuttering. Making a supreme effort he managed to get it out that he\\nhad \\\"come to thank the doctor\\\" for his recovery--\\\"but God first\\\"!\\n\\nThe two soldiers bit their lips; and even the doctor found it difficult\\nto keep a straight face.\\n\\n\\\"God first! Well said, my boy. Have you already thanked God?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, M'nheer, every evening in bed, and yesterday at church.\\\"\\n\\nLittle Sietske unable to control herself any longer had to laugh\\noutright. Her laughter threatened to become contagious. William was\\nbusier than usual with his nose; Hermann had come to life and was\\neyeing Walter slyly.\\n\\n\\\"Order!\\\" thundered the doctor, giving the table a rap with a ruler\\nthat made the globe tremble. Walter was frightened. \\\"Order! This is\\na nice caper during study-hours.\\\"\\n\\nThe clock began to strike. Sietske seemed to be counting, for at\\nevery stroke she raised a finger.\\n\\n\\\"I am going to----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Five!\\\" she cried. \\\"All my fingers--just look, five! Five o'clock,\\npapa--Tyrant! Hurrah, hurrah!\\\"\\n\\nBoth boys joined in the uproar. It was a quodlibet from \\\"Gaudeamus\\nigitur,\\\" \\\"Vive la joie,\\\" and \\\"God save the king.\\\" Forward, all! Vive\\nla vacance! A bas les tyrans! Revenge! * * * *\\n\\nThe children were determined to have their well earned romp; and they\\nhad it. Walter rubbed his eyes, and would not believe his ears. It\\nwas beyond his comprehension. * * * *\\n\\n\\\"That will do now,\\\" said the doctor. \\\"Come, mamma is waiting\\ndinner--and you, too, my boy!\\\"\\n\\nWilliam took Sietske on his back and Hermann mounted the father. Thus\\nthey descended the stairs, Walter bringing up the rear. Lady Macbeth\\nhad disappeared, being now crumpled up in Walter's breast-pocket.\\n\\nWalter was nonplussed. Was this the same man who used the gold\\npen?--whose coachman wore the furs?\\n\\nHow was it possible? Was it a dream, that he and all the family had\\nlooked on this man and simply been overcome by his dignity?\\n\\nHe couldn't understand it.\\n\\nAgain the atmosphere of the dining-room was quite different from that\\nof the schoolroom, either before or directly after five.\\n\\n\\\"Present the young gentleman to your mamma,\\\" said the doctor, turning\\nto William.\\n\\n\\\"May I do it?\\\" asked Sietske.\\n\\nDoctor Holsma nodded, and the little girl took Walter by the hand and\\nconducted him to a lady who sat at the head of the table preparing\\nthe salad.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma, this is a young gentleman--oh, I must know your name. What\\nis your name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Walter Pieterse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is Mr. Walter Pieterse, who has come to thank papa, because\\nhe--he was sick; and he--the young gentleman is going to stay for\\ndinner, papa?\\\"--the doctor nodded again--\\\"and he's going to stay for\\ndinner, mamma.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With mamma's consent,\\\" said the father.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, with mamma's consent.\\\"\\n\\nMevrouw Holsma spoke to Walter kindly and offered him a chair. It\\nwas necessary, too.\\n\\nEverything seemed so princely to Walter that he was glad to be\\nseated. Three-fourths of his little figure was hidden under the\\ntable. That was something gained. He was amazed at almost everything\\nhe saw and heard. He folded his hands.\\n\\n\\\"Do you want to say a grace, little man?\\\" asked the doctor.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, M'nheer,\\\" Walter stammered.\\n\\n\\\"A good custom. Do you always do that at the table?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, always--at warm meals, M'nheer!\\\"\\n\\nThose children had been taught good manners. Nobody smiled.\\n\\nWalter bowed his head for a moment; and the doctor took advantage\\nof the opportunity to give the children a look of warning. They\\nremembered; and, if afterwards Walter discovered that he had cut a\\nsingular figure in this household, they were not to blame.\\n\\n\\\"You do well to do it,\\\" said Holsma. \\\"We don't do it; and perhaps we\\ndo well not to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly,\\\" said the mother. \\\"Everyone must act according to his\\nown conviction.\\\"\\n\\nThis simple statement moved Walter more than any of them could have\\nimagined. He--a conviction! That short sentence of Mevrouw Holsma\\nattributed to him a dignity and importance that was strange to him,\\nand gave him a right he had never thought of before. Through the soup\\nhe was thinking continually: \\\"I may have a conviction!\\\"\\n\\nIt never occurred to him that a thing could be interpreted otherwise\\nthan it was interpreted for him by his mother or Stoffel, or some\\nother grown-up person. The whole question of praying, or not praying,\\ndid not appear so important to him as this new fact, that he could\\nhave a conviction. His heart swelled.\\n\\nThe doctor, who understood Walter, recalled him from his thoughts.\\n\\n\\\"Everyone must act according to his conviction; and in order to come\\nto a conviction one has to reflect a long time over the matter. I\\nam convinced that our little guest would like to eat some of those\\npeas. Pass them to him, Sietske.\\\"\\n\\nWalter had grasped the import of Holsma's words, and also the meaning\\nof this transition to the peas. Walter felt--without putting his\\nfeelings into words--that the pedantry of the schoolroom had been put\\naside at five o'clock, and that his host merely wanted to give him a\\nfriendly warning against dogmatic bigotry, without tainting the fresh,\\nwholesome atmosphere of the dining-room.\\n\\nDespite his shy, retiring nature--or, better, in connection with this\\ncharacteristic--Walter was an extremely intelligent boy. This fact\\nhad escaped almost everybody he had come in contact with because of\\nhis lack of self-confidence, which prevented him from revealing his\\ntrue self. He usually seemed to comprehend more slowly than others;\\nbut this was because he was less easily satisfied with the result of\\nhis thinking. His mind was exacting of knowledge. During Walter's\\nsickness Holsma had remarked this peculiarity of the boy, and his\\ninterest had been enlisted at once.\\n\\nWalter's shyness was due in a great measure to the manner in which\\nhe had been taught what little he knew. Everything his teachers\\ntaught him was looked upon by them as something immutable and\\nirrefutable. Twice two is four, Prince so-and-so is a hero, good\\nchildren go to heaven, God is great, the Reform Church represents the\\ntrue faith, etc., etc. It was never hinted to him that there was any\\nroom for doubt. Indeed, he was led to believe that his desire to know\\nmore about things was improper and even sinful.\\n\\nAfter all those extraordinary occurrences in the study, Walter was\\nprepared to expect almost anything in the way of the unusual, but\\nthat William and Hermann, and even little Sietske, were allowed to\\nhelp their plates to whatever they wanted--that was more wonderful\\nto him than the a\\u00ebrial voyage of Elias. With Genevi\\u00e8ve in the famous\\nwilderness--yes, even in Africa it couldn't be any more free and\\neasy. He was continually surprised and taken off his guard by the\\nunwonted and unexpected. In fact, his thoughts were so far away that\\nwhen during dessert the little girl passed him a saucer of cream----\\n\\nYe gods, it happened and--I must tell it. Oh, if like the\\nchroniclers of old, I might put the blame on some privy councilor,\\n\\\"who unfortunately advised,\\\" etc.\\n\\nBut what privy councilor in the whole world could have advised Walter\\nto let that porcelain spoon tilt over the edge of the saucer and fall\\ninto Sietske's lap! He did it, he!\\n\\nOh, how sad it was. He had just begun to pull himself up in his\\nchair. Another moment and he would have actually been sitting. Perhaps\\nhe might have said something soon. The name of a certain country in\\nAfrica, which Sietske could not remember a moment before, had occurred\\nto him. It was not that he might seem smarter than Sietske that he\\nwas going to speak out. No, it was only that he might seem a little\\nless stupid than himself. But now--that miserable spoon!\\n\\nBefore he had time to wonder how his awkwardness would be received,\\nSietske was talking along smoothly about something else--just as if\\nthis little \\\"catastrophe\\\" was a matter of course.\\n\\n\\\"Papa, you were going to tell us something about Olivier van Noort.\\\"\\n\\nShe arose, wiped off her little skirt and fetched Walter another\\nspoon from the buffet.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, papa, Olivier van Noort! You promised it, papa.\\\"\\n\\nAll urged him to tell the story. Even Mevrouw Holsma manifested great\\ninterest in it. Walter was aware that this conversation was intended\\nto cover up his accident. He was moved; for he was not accustomed to\\nanything like this. As Sietske took her seat again she noticed a tear\\ncreeping down across his cheek.\\n\\n\\\"Mamma, I got a silver spoon. That's just as good, isn't it? These\\nporcelain things are so heavy and awkward. They've fallen out of my\\nhand three times; and Hermann can't manage them, either.\\\"\\n\\nThe mother nodded to her.\\n\\n\\\"And how it is with Olivier van Noort?\\\"\\n\\nThe door-bell rang, and almost immediately afterwards a gentleman\\nentered the room who was greeted by the children as Uncle Sybrand.\\n\\nThe host now invited all to the garden and sent Hermann to the study\\nfor a book.\\n\\n\\\"You young rascal, don't you go now and maliciously break that\\nglobe. It can't help it.\\\"\\n\\nThen came the story of Admiral Olivier van Noort and the poor\\nVice-Admiral Jan Claesz van Ilpendam, who was put ashore in the Strait\\nof Magellan for insubordination. It interested all, and called forth\\na lively discussion, in which the entire family as well as the guests\\ntook part.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\n\\nTo readers of a certain class of fiction it will no doubt seem strange\\nif I say that Walter's visit to the Holsma family influenced greatly\\nhis spiritual development. Not immediately; but a seed had been planted\\nwhich was to grow later. He saw now that after all independent thought\\nwas possible, even if he could not yet allow himself that luxury. The\\nmere knowledge that there were other opinions in the world than those\\nof his daily mentors was a long stride forward.\\n\\nHe was depressed on account of his lack of knowledge. Those children\\nknew so much more than he did; and this made him sad.\\n\\nThey had spoken of someone who was startled to find footprints. Who\\nwas it? The child had never heard of Defoe's hermit. He asked Stoffel.\\n\\n\\\"Footprints? Footprints? Well, you must tell me what footprints you\\nmean--whose footprints. You must give names when you ask questions.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right,\\\" said the mother, \\\"when you want to know anything\\nyou must mention names. And Mevrouw made the salad herself? Well,\\nthat's strange. The girl must have been out somewhere.\\\"\\n\\nAs to other \\\"strange\\\" things, which were not likely to meet the\\napprobation of his family, Walter was silent. Not a word about\\nthat Saturnalia, or the omission of grace at a \\\"warm meal\\\"! Nor\\ndid he mention the liberties that were allowed the children, or the\\nfreedom with which they joined in the conversation. Perhaps it was\\na superfluous precaution. That bearskin would have been excused for\\nmany shortcomings.\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse asked repeatedly if he had been \\\"respectable.\\\" Walter\\nsaid he had, but without knowing exactly what she meant. That affair\\nwith the spoon--had it been respectable? He didn't care to have this\\nquestion decided--at least by his mother. But it was nice of Sietske;\\nand wouldn't he have done the same?\\n\\nHe learned that the day was approaching when he must return to\\nschool. More than ever he felt that this source of knowledge was\\ninsufficient for him; but opposition was not to be thought of. He\\nwas dissatisfied with himself, with everything.\\n\\n\\\"I shall never amount to anything,\\\" he sighed.\\n\\nHis Lady Macbeth seemed uglier to him than ever. He tore her up. And\\nOphelia?\\n\\nGoodness! He hadn't thought of Femke the whole day. Was it because\\nshe was only a wash-girl, while the doctor's children were so\\naristocratic? Walter censured himself.\\n\\nHe took advantage of the first opportunity to pay his debt in that\\nquarter. For he felt that it was a debt; and this consciousness gave\\nhim courage. Picture in hand, he passed the familiar fence this time\\nand knocked boldly on the door. His heart was thumping terribly;\\nbut he must do it! In a moment he stood before Femke. The lady of\\nhis heart was quietly darning stockings. It is hard on the writer;\\nbut this little detail was a matter of indifference to Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" she cried, extending her hand. \\\"Mother, this is the young\\ngentleman we saw that time--the little boy who was so sick. And how\\nare you now? You look pale.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Take a seat, little boy,\\\" said the mother. \\\"Yes, you do look\\npale. Worms, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no, mother. The child has had nervous fever.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right--fever, then; but it could be from worms. Give him a cup,\\nFemke. It won't hurt you to drink coffee; but if it were worms----\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Claus's worms were more in Walter's way than the stockings.\\n\\n\\\"Where does your mother have her washing done?\\\" she asked. \\\"Not that\\nI want to pump you--not at all. But if she isn't satisfied with her\\nwash-woman--it sometimes happens, you understand. Everybody must\\nlook out for himself; and I just thought I'd mention it. Whenever\\nthere are any ink-spots Femke takes them out with oxalic acid; and\\nit never makes any holes--yes, it did happen once, and we had to pay\\nfor a pair of cuffs. You can ask Femke.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact was, he wanted to ask Femke something else; and she knew\\nit. The story of Aztalpa had left its marks on her mind. But she\\nwas hampered very much like Walter was at home. She couldn't say,\\n\\\"Mother, speak a bit more Peruvian!\\\" So she simply asked what the\\nroll was that he had in his hand.\\n\\nWalter was confused, but he managed to stammer that it was a present\\nfor her. Femke said she would always take good care of the picture.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the mother, \\\"and you must iron out those creases. We iron,\\ntoo, little boy, and we deliver the clothes ready to put on. Nobody can\\ncomplain. You can tell your mother. And your collar--it isn't ironed\\nnicely--and such bluing! Ask Femke. Femke, isn't the blue in stripes?\\\"\\n\\nHis collar not ironed nicely? and blued in stripes? And the infallible\\nPietro had laundered it! Even here, were there differences in method\\nand conception? And in this respect, too, was the Pieterse tradition\\nnot the only one that brought happiness?\\n\\nFemke was on nettles. She studied Ophelia, wondering who she was,\\nand tried to turn the conversation. At last something occurred to\\nher. It was necessary for her to run some errand or other, and \\\"the\\nyoung gentleman\\\" could \\\"accompany\\\" her a part of the way.\\n\\n\\\"As far as I'm concerned,\\\" said the mother.\\n\\nThe young couple retired, taking one of those ways which in the\\nneighborhood of Amsterdam are simply called \\\"the ways.\\\" That is all\\nthey are. Whoever walks there for pleasure must take a good stock of\\nimpressions with him, in order to escape tedium.\\n\\nBut Walter and Femke were not lacking in this respect. Walter had\\nso much to tell Femke that he could scarcely hope to get through;\\nand she, too, had thought of him more than she was willing to admit,\\nand more than he had any idea of. She began by saying that she hadn't\\ntold her mother of her unfriendly reception by Walter's mother and\\nsisters, because she didn't want her mother----\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Femke--and you thought I would come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\" said Femke, hesitating, but still with a readiness that\\ndelighted Walter. \\\"Yes, of course I expected to see you again. And\\nI had a mass said for your recovery.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Really?\\\" said Walter, who hardly knew what it meant.  \\\"You did that\\nfor me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and I prayed, too. I should have been sad if you had died. For\\nI believe you are a good boy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I ought to have come sooner; and I wanted to, but--Femke, I was\\nafraid.\\\"\\n\\nHe related to her how he had been near her on Sunday. The girl\\nattributed his timidity to his diffidence toward her mother.\\n\\n\\\"My mother is a good woman. She wouldn't hurt anybody, but--you\\nunderstand. She doesn't mix with people much. I understand the\\nworld better, because, you see, I was a nurse for three weeks. I was\\nonly substituting; I was too young to be a real nurse. It was at a\\nrelation's of ours, where the girl was sick. You know we really come\\nof a good family. But that makes no difference. Tell me, are you well\\nand strong again?\\\"\\n\\nWalter told her now all about his sickness, and soon he came\\ninvoluntarily to the thing that gave him most trouble, his defective\\nknowledge.\\n\\n\\\"All the children know French; but at our school it isn't taught. It's\\nimpossible to be a great man without knowing French.\\\"\\n\\nWalter had difficulty in explaining to her that he meant something\\nother than the possession of three houses, though that might not\\nbe bad.\\n\\n\\\"I should like--you understand? I should like--yes--I should like--how\\nshall I explain?\\\"\\n\\nThe sovereignty of Africa was on the end of his tongue; but he didn't\\nhave the courage to put his dreams into words.\\n\\n\\\"You know, Femke, that we live here in Europe. Now, down there in the\\nsouth, far away--I will draw it for you. We can sit down here and I\\nwill show you exactly what I mean.\\\"\\n\\nHe selected some small sticks suitable for making outlines on the\\nground, then he and Femke sat down on a low pile of boards. He\\nproceeded to scratch up the sand for some distance around.\\n\\n\\\"That is Europe. The earth is round; that is, it consists of\\ntwo halves, like a doughnut. You see, it looks like a pair of\\nspectacles. With that half we are not concerned. That's America. You\\ncan put your feet on it if you want to. Here is where we live; there\\nis England; and here is Africa. The people there are uncivilized. They\\ncan't read, and they don't wear many clothes. But when a traveler\\ncomes along they are very nice to him--the book says so. I'm going\\ndown there and teach all the people to read and give them clothes and\\nsee to it that there is no injustice done in the whole land. And then\\nwe will----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I, too?\\\" asked Femke in amazement.\\n\\n\\\"Why, certainly! I wanted to ask you if you were willing to go with\\nme. We will be man and wife, you understand; so when I get to be king\\nyou will be----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I? Queen?\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed. Involuntarily she rose and trampled to pieces all the\\nkingdoms that Walter had just laid at her feet.\\n\\n\\\"But--won't you be my wife?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you boy! How did you get such nonsense into your head? You are\\nstill a child!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you wait then till I'm grown up? Will you let me be your friend?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly! Only you mustn't think of that nonsense--not that you may\\nnot go to Africa later. Why not? Many people go on journeys. Formerly\\nthere lived a carpenter near us, and he went to the Haarlem with his\\nwhole family. But--marrying!\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed again. It pained Walter. The poor boy's first proposal\\nwas turning out badly.\\n\\nSuddenly Femke became serious.\\n\\n\\\"I know that you are a good boy; and I think a great deal of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I!\\\" cried Walter. \\\"Femke, I have thought of you all the time--when\\nI was sick--in my fever--I don't know what I thought of in my fever,\\nbut I think it must have been you. And I talked to the picture I\\npainted for you as if it were you; and that picture answered like you\\nand looked like you. I was Kusco and Telasco, and you were Aztalpa,\\nthe daughter of the sun. Tell me, Femke, may I be your friend?\\\"\\n\\nThe girl reflected a moment; and in her pure, innocent heart\\nshe felt the desire to do good. Was that seventeen-year-old girl\\nconscious of the influence that Walter's childish soul exerted upon\\nher? Scarcely. But she wanted to give him a less cruel answer.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, certainly you shall be my friend. But--but----\\\"\\n\\nShe was hunting for some excuse that would not hurt him, and still let\\nhim see the difference in their ages. He had grown during his illness,\\nto be sure, but still--she could have carried him on her arm. And he\\nhad dreamed of rescuing her from a fire!\\n\\n\\\"My friend, yes. But then you must do everything that I require.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everything, everything! Tell me quick what I can do for you.\\\"\\n\\nIt was painful for the girl. She didn't know what she should require;\\nbut she was under the necessity of naming something. She had always\\nheard that it was good for children to study hard. What if she should\\nspur him on to do that?\\n\\n\\\"Listen, Walter. Just for fun I told my mother that you were the best\\nin school.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I?\\\" cried Walter abashed.\\n\\n\\\"Study hard and be the first in school inside the next three months,\\\"\\nsaid Femke to the conqueror of continents, unaware of the sarcasm\\nthat lay in her words. \\\"Otherwise, you see, my mother might think\\nI had made fun of you; and I don't want that to happen. If you will\\nonly do that----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will do it, Femke!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you must go home and begin at once.\\\"\\n\\nThus she sent him away. As she told him \\\"Good-bye\\\" she noticed all\\nat once that he was too large for her to kiss. A few hours later,\\nwhen Father Jansen was calling on her mother and incidentally saw\\nWalter's painting, Walter suddenly became a child again. The priest\\nhad said that in Dutch Ophelia meant Flora, who was the patron-saint\\nof roses and forget-me-nots.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that picture is from a little boy, a very small boy. He's about\\nten years old--or nine. He's certainly not older than nine!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Girl, you are foolish!\\\" cried the mother. \\\"The boy is fifteen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that may be--but I just meant that he's still only a child.\\\"\\n\\nShe stuck Ophelia away in some hidden nook, and Mrs. Claus and Father\\nJansen never saw that new edition of the old flower-goddess again.\\n\\n\\\"Femke, I will do it!\\\" Walter had said.\\n\\nThere was really reason to believe that he would learn faster now;\\nbut Pennewip's instruction would wear Femke's colors. Walter knew\\nvery well that in requiring this service she had had his own welfare\\nin view; but this showed her interest in him, and was not so bad. How\\nwould it have looked, he thought, if, after all that had gone before,\\nhe had answered: \\\"Everything except that!\\\"\\n\\nOf course he would have greatly preferred to serve his lady on some\\njourney full of adventure. But one cannot select for one's self\\nheroic deeds. In these days Hercules and St. George would have to\\nput up with miniature dragons.\\n\\nAt all events, Walter took hold of his work in earnest. He studied his\\n\\\"Ippel,\\\" his \\\"Strabbe,\\\" his \\\"National History\\\" and even the \\\"Gender\\nof Nouns,\\\" and everything else necessary to the education of a good\\nNetherlander. Poetry was included; and Walter's accomplishments along\\nthis line were such that other \\\"Herculeses\\\" might have envied him.\\n\\nHe had never read the stories of tournaments. No enchantress gave\\nhim a charmed coat of mail; no Minerva put the head of Medusa on\\nhis shield--no, nothing of all that. But--Keesje, the butcher's boy,\\nmight look sharp for his laurels!\\n\\nIn justice to Walter it must be said that he gave his opponent fair\\nwarning, in true knightly style.\\n\\nAt the end of three months Walter was actually the first in his\\nclasses. Pennewip was compelled to take notice of it.\\n\\n\\\"It is strange,\\\" he remarked. \\\"I might say that it is remarkable. Yes,\\nin a way, it is unprecedented--without a parallel!\\\"\\n\\nAt home the result was that a great council was held regarding Walter's\\nfuture. He didn't want to become a compositor; and to be a sailor--that\\nwould have suited him, but his mother was opposed to it. Stoffel,\\ntoo, objected on the ground that usually only young people who are\\nworthless on land are sent to sea.\\n\\nThus Walter's plans for conquest were slipping away from him. He\\nwas not attracted by the brilliant careers that were proposed: They\\nleft Africa out of account. He didn't want to be a school-teacher,\\nor a shoemaker, or a clerk, or a counter-jumper.\\n\\nHowever, after all authorities had been heard, Stoffel came\\nto the conclusion that Walter was peculiarly well fitted for\\n\\\"business.\\\" Juffrouw Pieterse agreed with him thoroughly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\n\\n\\\"A responsible business firm wants a young man (Dt. Ref.) of good\\nfamily. He must be moral, well-behaved and not under fifteen years\\nold. Prospect of salary if diligent and reliable. Good treatment\\nguaranteed. Address written applications in own handwriting to\\n'Business,' care E. Maaskamp's book and art store, Nieuwendyk,\\nAmsterdam.\\\"\\n\\nThe writer cannot recall what sort of art publications E. Maaskamp was\\ndealing in just at that time, and will not make any guesses, for fear\\nof getting the reader into chronological difficulties. If it should\\nbecome necessary in writing Walter's history, the writer would have\\nno compunctions of conscience in putting the republic after Louis,\\nor William I. before the republic.\\n\\nAnd as for that \\\"Dt. Ref.\\\"--Dutch Reform--in the advertisement--that\\ngives the writer no trouble. He knows very well that \\\"Dt. Ref.\\\" as a\\nnecessary qualification for servants, apprentices, etc., was introduced\\nafter E. Maaskamp's pictures had been forgotten. Nevertheless, it\\nmust be insisted upon that the aforesaid abbreviation was in the\\nadvertisement which was now occupying the undivided attention of\\nthe Pieterses.\\n\\n\\\"There couldn't be anything more fortunate,\\\" said the mother. \\\"What\\ndo you think, Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother, it couldn't be better.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What pleases me especially is the 'well-behaved.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Moral and well-behaved, mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, moral and well-behaved--do you hear, Walter? Just as I have\\nalways said. And 'prospect of salary.' What do you think of that,\\nStoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother; but--he must be 'diligent and reliable.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Walter, you must be diligent and reliable. Haven't I always told\\nyou that? And they require 'Dt. Ref.'; but you are that, thank God.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother, he's that all right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Stoffel, don't you think you'd better write the letter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But it says 'in own handwriting.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's so! But if you write the letter in your own handwriting--that\\nwill be better than for such a child to write it.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel had some difficulty in making it plain to his mother that\\n\\\"own handwriting\\\" meant Walter's own handwriting; but she finally\\nsaw the point, and Walter was given a seat at the table.\\n\\n\\\"Well? What must I write at the top?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, have you forgotten that again? Such a simple thing? Have you\\ngot down the date? Then write 'Gentlemen,' in business style. It says,\\n'responsible business firm.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the mother, \\\"and add that your father had a business,\\ntoo. We sold shoes from Paris. Otherwise they will think we're only\\nshoemakers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And write that you are the first in school.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that you belong to the Dutch Reform Church.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that you are moral and well-behaved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that you are diligent and reliable. Don't you see, you may get\\na salary then right away.\\\"\\n\\nAt last the letter was ready. It only remained to stamp it and post\\nit. But why couldn't the young applicant deliver the letter in person\\nand save the postage? Stoffel thought there would be no impropriety\\nin such a course. Even a responsible business firm ought to overlook\\nsuch a detail.\\n\\nWith a heavy heart Walter started out on his important errand. He was\\nentering the real world, and was about to become a worshiper of the\\ngreat god of \\\"business.\\\" He was depressed by his lack of confidence,\\nand felt that it was unbecoming in himself to make application to a\\n\\\"responsible business firm.\\\"\\n\\nIf he met a man that looked well-to-do, he would ask himself if\\nthe gentleman was a \\\"business man,\\\" and belonged to a \\\"responsible\\nbusiness firm.\\\" This last high-sounding expression embodied mysteries\\nwhich he did not attempt to understand. He would learn it all later.\\n\\nWalter stammered an excuse to the young fellow in the shop for not\\nhaving sent his letter by post. The fellow didn't understand him, but\\nthrew the letter carelessly into a box containing a few dozen others\\nthat were awaiting the favorable consideration of Messrs. Motto,\\nBusiness & Co.\\n\\nThe fellow was busy with some Turkish battles in glaring colors,\\nand declined to enter into any conversation with our hero. Walter's\\nmouth watered for a bright picture of Grecian chivalry. But what good\\ndid it do? He had no money; and, besides, he was out for business,\\nnot for heroic deeds.\\n\\n\\\"Later!\\\" he thought.\\n\\nArrived at home he received the usual scolding. His mother maintained\\nthat he had certainly not entered the shop in a \\\"respectable\\\" manner;\\notherwise the young gentleman would have given him a friendlier\\nreception. She was afraid that those excellent gentlemen, Motto,\\nBusiness & Co., would take this into consideration to his detriment.\\n\\n\\\"And you say there were already a whole lot of letters there? You\\nsee, Stoffel--if he only isn't too late! That's the way--those people\\nwould break their necks or be first. And who knows but what some of\\nthem are Roman Catholics? I wonder if they all think they're moral\\nand well-behaved. You can just see what kind of people there are in\\nthe world!\\\"\\n\\nWalter had to go back to Maaskamp's and get the address of the firm\\nin question. The idea was for him to call on the firm in person and\\nthus get ahead of everybody else. Juffrouw Pieterse wanted to bet her\\nears that not a one of the other applicants could boast of a father\\nwho had sold Parisian shoes.\\n\\n\\\"Tell them that! Your father never took a stitch in his life. He\\ndidn't even know how to. It's only to prove that we had a business,\\ntoo. He never had an awl in his hand--isn't it so, Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\nThose eminently respectable gentlemen, Motto, Business & Co., lived--I\\ndon't know where they lived; but they had founded on the Zeedyk a\\ncigar store and a circulating library. It was probably not far from\\nthe place where six or eight centuries earlier a few fishermen had\\nfounded the greatest commercial city of Europe.\\n\\nWalter found one of those worthy gentlemen behind the counter. He was\\nin his shirt-sleeves, and was engaged in weighing out some snuff for\\nan old woman. \\\"Business\\\" was evidently being carried on.\\n\\nAs Walter had formed no conception of \\\"responsible business firm,\\\"\\nhe was far from thinking that the gentlemen had claimed too much for\\nthemselves. With his peculiar timidity he even reproached himself\\nfor not having understood the conception \\\"business\\\" before.\\n\\nNow he understood it. Business meant to stand behind a counter,\\nin shirt-sleeves, and weigh snuff. And, too, on the Zeedyk.\\n\\nThe cigar store occupied only half the width of the house, and was\\nconnected with the circulating library by a side door. Motto, Business\\n& Co. were simultaneously cultivating two industries: those who didn't\\ncare for snuff or tobacco could get something to read, and vice versa.\\n\\nOver the shelves, on the tobacco side, were posted signs bearing the\\nassurance that something was \\\"manufactured\\\" here. Differing entirely\\nfrom the Pieterses, these gentlemen seemed to think that to make\\na thing meant more than merely to sell it. We leave the question\\nundecided.\\n\\nWas it true that this business firm manufactured anything? The only\\nthing they manufactured was the paper bags that were to be pasted\\ntogether by the moral, well-behaved, diligent and reliable young man\\nwho was a member of the Dutch Reform Church.\\n\\nThe amount of business done was small, the profits barely paying the\\nrent. The wicked world on the Zeedyk even said that the two blue\\nporcelain vases bearing in old-fashioned letters the inscriptions\\n\\\"Rappee\\\" and \\\"Zinking,\\\" had been borrowed from a second-hand dealer\\nin the neighborhood, and that the good man came by every day to look\\nafter his property.\\n\\nThe shop was small, and was closed off in the rear by a green curtain,\\nwhich was calculated to make customers think there was something more\\nbeyond. To be exact, there was something beyond that curtain. There\\nhung a dilapidated mirror, consoling with a lonely chair, which was\\nnow ornamented by the coat of the worthy senior partner; and leaning\\nagainst the wall was a half-round table, on which a pomatum-pot\\nwas making fun of a comb because for years it had been expecting\\nto grow new teeth. Business was not so exacting but that Mr. Motto\\ncould devote a little spare time to the improvement of his personal\\nbeauty. He had succeeded in developing two beautiful bunches of hair\\non the sides of his face. They cost him much pains and grease; but\\nthey were the delight of all the ladies who entered the shop.\\n\\n\\\"And so you want to go into business, do you?\\\" asked Mr. Motto,\\nafter he had given the old woman a \\\"pinch\\\" from the jar. \\\"What all\\nhave you studied? Reading, writing, arithmetic, French? Eh? And what\\nare your parents.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They dealt in shoes--from Paris, M'neer. But I don't know\\nFrench. Arithmetic--yes. Went through Strabbe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you know arithmetic, do you? How much then is a Pietje and\\na half?\\\"\\n\\nWalter stammered that he didn't know. Does the reader know?\\n\\n\\\"But you must know that if you expect to calculate. And you don't know\\nwhat a Pietje is? Do you know the difference between a sesthalf and\\na shilling? And between a dollar and a twenty-eight piece? Look----\\\"\\n\\nMr. Motto pulled out the cash-drawer and seemed to be hunting for a\\ndollar; but for some reason or other he decided to make out with a\\nsesthalf. This he laid on the counter and asked Walter to imagine a\\nshilling lying beside it. He then proceeded to test Walter's knowledge\\nof business by asking him to point out the differences between the\\ntwo coins. Mr. Motto claimed that in business one must know these\\ndetails thoroughly.\\n\\nAnd Mr. Motto was right about it. At that time there were more\\ndifferent kinds of money in the Netherlands than there are in Germany\\nnow. To be able to distinguish the various coins readily and make\\nchange accurately a regular course of study was necessary. Just\\nas a law was about to be passed to confer the title, \\\"Doctor of\\nNumismatics,\\\" on examination, the secretary of the treasury discovered\\nthat all this trouble could be spared by simplifying the money. He\\nbecame very unpopular after this.\\n\\nIn Walter's time, though, such a reform had not been thought of. The\\nflorin had twenty stivers; the regular Holland dollar had fifty\\nstivers, the Zeeland dollar had forty-two. The dollar was worth a\\nflorin and a half, and the gold florin was called a \\\"twenty-eight,\\\"\\nbecause it contained twenty-eight stivers. The coins were well-worn and\\nseldom exhibited any traces of inscriptions, milling, etc. Matters were\\nfurther complicated by three-florin pieces and ducats of sixty-three\\nstivers, not to mention any other coins.\\n\\nFor Walter the money question was a serious one.\\n\\n\\\"And you don't know French, either?\\\" in a tone that was scarcely\\nencouraging.\\n\\n\\\"No----\\\" mournfully.\\n\\n\\\"And would your parents put up cash security for you?\\\"\\n\\nWalter didn't understand the question.\\n\\n\\\"Caution. Don't you understand? Security! There's lots of money\\nhandled, and I must know who I'm turning the shop over to. And--do\\nyou know Danish?\\\"\\n\\nMr. Motto did not always speak grammatically.\\n\\n\\\"No--M'neer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What! Nor Danish, either? But Danish sailors come in here to buy\\ntobacco, and then you need to speak Danish. In a business like this\\nhere you must know all languages. That's the main thing--otherwise\\nyour cake's dough! I've even had Greeks to come in here.\\\"\\n\\nWalter's heart gave a jump. What heroic deeds might they not do on\\nsuch occasions!\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Greeks; but they were drunk and wanted a smoke for nothing. We\\ndon't do it that way. The main thing is to look out for the\\nlittle things. Otherwise your cake's dough, you understand. Yes,\\nin business you must know all languages, otherwise you can't talk\\nto the customers. That's the main thing. But that will be all right\\nif your parents can deposit a caution. Sometimes there are at least\\nten florins in the cash-drawer, you know; and in business a man must\\nhave security. That's the main thing. Otherwise your cake's dough;\\nyou can see that for yourself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My father is dead,\\\" said Walter, as if that fact rendered the cash\\nsecurity unnecessary. He didn't know anything else to say.\\n\\n\\\"That so? Dead! Yes, it often happens. Dead? All right! But haven't\\nyou a mother who can pay for you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I--will--ask--her,\\\" Walter stammered.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. Ask her right away; for you know in business things\\nare done in a hurry. Said, done! That's the main thing. Otherwise\\nyour cake's dough. Here is another shop, and you will have work to\\ndo in there, too--if your mother can put up the money. That's the\\nmain thing.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Motto conducted Walter into the circulating library. On three sides\\nof the room were bookcases reaching to the rather low ceiling. For the\\nrest, the place was provided with a ladder to be used in gathering\\nsuch fruits of literature as hung out of reach. And then there was\\na big, thick book, in which the diligent and reliable young man of\\nProtestant faith was to enroll the names of the people who paid a\\ndubbeltje a week for a book. It's cheaper now.\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" said Mr. Motto, \\\"that is the book, so to say the great\\nbook. You understand bookkeeping, don't you?\\\"\\n\\nUnfortunately Walter had to admit that he had not yet studied that\\nbranch.\\n\\n\\\"Nor bookkeeping, either? Boy! that's the main thing in business. If\\na man can't do that his cake's dough. It's very simple. You write down\\nwho takes out a book, with the day and date and street and number. And\\nwhen they bring the book back you drawn a line through it; and you've\\ngot a pretty kettle of fish if you don't do it. When you don't know\\nthe people you must----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ask for a deposit!\\\" cried Walter quickly, rejoiced that he knew\\nsomething. It's doubtful if he knew what he was to draw the line\\nthrough.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, a deposit. A florin a week for a volume. Then, you understand,\\nwhen a volume's gone, the cake's dough with that volume. Later I will\\nexplain to you everything about the cigars and tobacco; but first\\nI must know whether your mother--ask her right away! And now I've\\nexplained everything to you at least half a dozen times. For there's\\nno lack of boys that want to go into business; but when it comes to\\nMoses and the Prophets--then they set the bow-sails. And that's the\\nmain thing. Otherwise you look a little delicate, but I must know\\nfirst if your mother can deposit a caution. Adieu!\\\"\\n\\nWalter went home in a peculiar frame of mind. At first the family\\ndid not think favorably of that \\\"cash security.\\\" Stoffel, however,\\nhad often heard of such things, and negotiations were opened with\\nthe said firm. It was finally agreed that a deposit of one hundred\\nflorins should be made, for which the firm agreed to pay 3 1/2%\\ninterest. Juffrouw Pieterse was not quite satisfied with this, as\\nshe was accustomed to getting 4%; but \\\"one must do something for\\none's children.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel, who represented the Pieterses in these negotiations, was\\nsurprised that he never got to see more than the first half of\\nthe firm--or, better, the first third. He even took the liberty\\nof remarking on the peculiar circumstance, when he learned that\\nthe \\\"Co.\\\" was merely ornamental, while \\\"Business\\\" existed only in\\nMr. Motto's imagination. In fact that handsome and worthy gentleman\\nalone constituted the \\\"responsible business firm,\\\" and like an Atlas\\ncarried on his broad shoulders all the responsibilities incident to\\nsuch a complicated and extensive undertaking. It was quite natural\\nthat he should desire to put a part of the burden on the back of some\\ndiligent, reliable Protestant boy, who could furnish cash security. For\\nthat was \\\"the main thing.\\\"\\n\\nOn the library side Walter developed a diligence against which only\\none thing could be urged: it was prejudicial to the tobacco industry\\nadjoining. If he had smoked as much as he read, he would have made\\nhimself sick; and even his reading wasn't the best thing in the world\\nfor his health.\\n\\nHe devoured everything indiscriminately--whether ripe or green. Most\\nof that literary fruit was green. In a short time he was able to\\nforetell the fate of the hero with a certainty that would have piqued\\nthe author. The cleverest literary craftsman couldn't let the poor\\norphan boy be as poor as a church mouse for ten pages, but that\\nWalter would see the flashing of the stars and knightly crucifixes\\nwith which he was to be decked out on the last page. One might think\\nthis would cause him to lose interest in the book; but, no! He was\\nconstant to the end--to the official triumph. For him it would have\\nbeen a sin to call to the Saxons and Normans a second too soon:\\n\\\"See if Ivanhoe isn't going to smash that big-mouthed Sir Brian de\\nBois-Guilbert!\\\" And all the time he felt as if he were--Ivanhoe? No,\\nas if he were the deity, who must give the hero strength to overcome\\nthat infamous scoundrel, Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\\n\\nThen all at once the door-bell would ring, and the magnanimous Walter\\nwould have to occupy himself with things less chivalrous.\\n\\nThe only thing he could do in such moments was to weigh accurately,\\nand not give anybody a cigar from the \\\"tens\\\" instead of from\\nthe \\\"eights.\\\" Such conscienciousness, however, was futile, for\\nin the cigar-boxes were cigars that ought to have been called\\n\\\"twenties.\\\" Mr. Motto said that the customers were usually drunk,\\nand that it was all right to give them cabbage leaves to smoke. \\\"You\\nmust size up your customer. That's the main thing.\\\"\\n\\nThis was something Walter never could learn. With him, ten was ten,\\neight eight--no matter who the customer was. To take an unfair\\nadvantage, or tell a lie never occurred to him. From fear or\\nembarrassment he might possibly tell an untruth; but if he had been\\nasked a second time----\\n\\nAs strange as it may seem, this aversion to lying and deception\\nwas nourished by the books he read. The brave knight fought till he\\nwas victorious, or dead. Only the fatally wounded surrendered. All\\nthis had Walter's hearty endorsement: He would not have acted\\ndifferently. The beautiful heroine was loved by everybody; and the\\nrejected suitors died of despair, or joined some desperate band. All\\nquite proper. The good remained steadfast, in spite of the Devil and\\nall his machinations--yes, in spite of tedium. Once selected by the\\nauthor to be a high-toned, moral hero--then spotless garments! Walter\\nwondered if such a one could have a pain in the stomach, or suffer\\nother inconvenience. Certainly not in books!\\n\\nHe did not know that such perfection was humbug. He was satisfied\\nwhen the characters in such novels did what was required of them by\\nthe author. The villains were always betraying somebody; the heroes\\nkilled everything that got in their way; and the beautiful virgins\\ncharmed everybody. Even God, the God of romance, did his duty much\\nbetter than--but that's another detail.\\n\\nYesterday on the Zeedyk a big boy had beaten a little fellow. That\\nought to happen in a book. How all the knights would have come\\nrunning! Walter, too, was going to--but how could he help it if his\\nemployer called him back? \\\"What in the devil have you got to do with\\nthat? Your work is here in the store. You attend to your own business\\nnow, and don't mix yourself in other people's brawls. That's the\\nmain thing!\\\"\\n\\nAs a rule of conduct, this was not just what Walter was used to in\\nhis novels.\\n\\nDespite such interruptions he continued his reading. He was almost\\nready to begin on the last section of books, when he came to the\\nstore one morning and found everything locked up and under seal.\\n\\nThe worthy Mr. Motto, it seems, had gone to America, as a sailor;\\nand doubtless that was the \\\"main thing.\\\" The unfortunate owner of the\\ntwo snuff-vases had a big law suit over them. The point was whether\\nthey were a part of the assets, or not.\\n\\nOn the Zeedyk at Amsterdam such processes must be tried according\\nto Roman law; but as the Romans did not use snuff there is nothing\\nsaid about \\\"Rappee\\\" in the Roman laws. The writer doesn't know how\\nthe matter finally turned out. It is to be hoped that everybody got\\nwhat was coming to him.\\n\\nJuffrouw Pieterse, however, did not recover her hundred florins; and,\\nas usual, she groaned: \\\"There's always trouble with this boy.\\\"\\n\\nWalter couldn't help her. He had his own troubles: he had been cruelly\\ninterrupted in his reading. Of course the mysterious parentage of\\nthe young robber was perfectly clear to him; but still one likes to\\nsee whether one has guessed correctly, or not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n\\n\\\"Do you think stivers grow on my back?\\\" asked the mother the next\\nday. \\\"You still don't earn a doit! Do you have to buy tobacco for\\nold soldiers?\\\"\\n\\nWalter had nothing to say. Recently his mother had given him a shilling\\nto give to Holsma's maid. Walter neglected to do this, and spent one\\nstiver of the money on snuff for an old soldier.\\n\\nThe mother continued her tirade, making use of the word \\\"prodigue,\\\"\\nprodigal.\\n\\n\\\"No, mother,\\\" said Stoffel, \\\"that isn't it. He's behind in\\neverything. He doesn't know yet how to handle money, that's it!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. He doesn't know how to handle money! All the other children at\\nhis age--when they have a stiver they either save it or buy themselves\\nsomething. And he--what does he do? He goes and gives it away! Boy,\\nboy, will you never learn any sense?\\\"\\n\\nWalter was cut to the quick by the accusation of wastefulness and\\nprodigality. In his eyes a prodigal was somebody, a man! \\\"Prodigue,\\nprodigue,\\\" he murmured. He knew the word.\\n\\nIn one of the bedrooms hung a series of crude, highly colored pictures\\nillustrating the story of the prodigal son. The pictures were French;\\nand a study of the titles convinced the family that \\\"prodigue\\\" could\\nmean nothing but prodigal in the worst sense, i. e., \\\"lost.\\\" Stoffel\\nhad maintained this proposition against one of his colleagues, till\\nthat one drew a lexicon on him.\\n\\nAfter much argument it was decided to compromise on the \\\"mistake\\\"\\nin the French Bible by allowing \\\"prodigue\\\" to have sometimes the\\nmeaning of \\\"extravagant.\\\" Those pictures had afforded Walter much\\nfood for thought.\\n\\nFirst picture: The \\\"lost\\\" or prodigal son tells his father\\ngood-bye. The old gentleman wears a purple coat. Very pretty--but the\\nprodigal himself! A mantle floated about his shoulders--it seemed to\\nbe windy in the colonnade. It was princely; and his turkish trousers\\nwere of pure gold. At his side was a bent sabre, and on his head a\\nturban, with a stone in it--certainly onyx, or sardonox, or a pearl,\\nor a precious stone--or whatever it might be!\\n\\nThe old gentleman seemed to be out of humor; but no wonder--all those\\nloaded camels, and the slaves, and all the accessories for that long,\\nlong journey! A negro, as black as pitch, was holding a horse by\\nthe rein. Another negro was holding the stirrup, and seemed to say:\\n\\\"Off to the Devil; prodigal, get on!\\\"\\n\\nWhat boy wouldn't have been a prodigal son? The bent sabre alone was\\nworth the sin.\\n\\nSecond picture: Hm--hm. Wicked, wicked! Why, certainly; but not for\\nWalter, who in his innocence attached no importance to the extravagant\\ndresses of the \\\"Juffrouwen.\\\" It was sufficient that all were eating\\nand drinking bountifully, and that they were in good spirits and\\nenjoying themselves. How prettily one of the girls, in glossy silk,\\nwas leaning over the shoulder of the \\\"lost\\\" one! How much nicer to be\\nlost than found!--anyway, that was the impression the feast made on\\nWalter. The true purpose of the picture--to deter people from a life of\\ndissoluteness--escaped Walter entirely. Perhaps he knew what it meant;\\nbut in his heart he felt that it meant something else. What attracted\\nhim most was not the food and drink, under which the table \\\"groaned,\\\"\\nnor the sinful sensuality painted on the faces of the ladies. It was\\nthe freedom and unconventionality of the company that charmed him. In\\norder to emphasize the idea of prodigality, the painter had allowed\\nsome big dogs to upset an open cask of wine.\\n\\nThe wine was streaming, and straying away as if it were the lost\\nsinner. This pleased Walter immensely. None of the guests seemed to\\nnotice such a small trifle, not even the waiters. This ought to have\\nhappened just once in the Pieterse home--and even if it were only a\\nstein of beer!\\n\\nThe artist says to himself, Do you suppose I didn't foresee the\\nseductive influence of such a picture? The next one makes it all right!\\n\\nWell, maybe so.\\n\\nThird picture: Magnificent. How romantic this wilderness! Oh, to\\nsit there on that boulder and stare into the immeasurable depths of\\nthe universe--alone!\\n\\nTo think, think, think!\\n\\nNo schoolmaster, no mother, brother, or anyone to say what he\\nmust do with his heart, with his time, with his elbows, or with his\\nbreeches! That's the way Walter saw it. The young man there didn't even\\nhave on breeches; and he looked as if he wouldn't have been ashamed\\nto stretch himself out on his back, with his arms over his head, and\\nwatch with wide-open eyes the passing of the moon and stars. Walter\\nasked himself what he would think of when he had founded such an\\nempire of solitude.\\n\\nHm! Femke could sit on the boulder with him. Prodigal son--oh,\\nsin divine with her! He was surprised that in the whole Bible there\\nwas only one prodigal son. Of all sins this seemed to him the most\\nseductive.\\n\\nAnd the desert was so--endurable. There were trees in it, which one\\ncould climb, when one really got lost, or use to build a nice little\\ncabin--for Femke, of course.\\n\\nThe prodigal in the picture didn't seem to have thought of all\\nthat. Why wasn't the Juffrouw in green silk with him? She will come\\nsoon, Walter said to himself. Perhaps she's not quite through with\\nher prodigality. If she would only hurry up and come! He longs for\\nher. But that is the only annoyance that a genuine prodigal takes\\nwith him from the profane world into that capital wilderness.\\n\\nIt must be remarked in passing, however, that the hogs with which\\nthat picture was equipped looked ugly. The pious artist had made them\\nshield-bearers of sin, and had supplied their physiognomies with all\\nkinds of horrible features. And, too, the trough looked dirty.\\n\\nIf it happens to me, said Walter, I'll take sheep with me; and Femke\\ncan card the wool.\\n\\nThe artist ought to admit that even this third picture is inadequate\\nto inspire a proper disgust for prodigality.\\n\\nAnd the fourth one? No better.\\n\\nThe old gentleman is excessively friendly. We are again in the\\ncolonnade, where the camels have just waited so patiently. One of the\\nslaves clasps his hands and looks toward heaven--because he's glad,\\nof course, that little Walter has come back.\\n\\nHe? The real Walter? Returned home, and friendly received in his high\\nrank of a \\\"has-been\\\" and \\\"recovered\\\" prodigal? Oh, no!\\n\\nAnd that fatted calf! In direct opposition to the custom that was\\nfamiliar to Walter! It worried the boy. Juffrouw Pieterse never\\nslaughtered anything. She ran a weekly account with Keesje's father;\\nand even a roast was a rarity.\\n\\nThere was no prospect of a fatted calf, whether he became a prodigal\\nor not. But that didn't keep the rank of a prodigal from being higher\\nthan that of a stupid boy who didn't know how to handle money.\\n\\nHe was encouraged to think that he was indebted to his friendly\\nenemy, Juffrouw Laps, for something. She always cited the Bible,\\nand spoke continually of feeding swine. Walter wanted to answer:\\n\\\"That's very nice, Juffrouw Laps, but can't it be sheep this time?\\\"\\n\\nHe knew very well that she had never had any passion for carding,\\nand consequently was not interested in that blue muffler, which would\\nbe so becoming to Femke's favorite sheep.\\n\\nBut she assured him that he was a prodigal; and that was enough.\\n\\n\\\"That's what I've always said!\\\" replied Juffrouw Pieterse. \\\"What\\ndoes he do but squander his mother's money? If that man wants snuff,\\nlet him buy it. The king pays him. I have to work too hard for my\\nmoney. Don't I, Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother; but it's only childishness in Walter!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Childishness! That's what I call it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No it isn't!\\\" cried the pious Laps. \\\"He's on the straight road to\\nthe trough of Luke 15. He will eat husks! Do you think the Master\\ndoesn't carry out his parables? Just send him to me. The pastors are\\nto blame for it. They don't explain the Bible. Send him to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I only knew how he gets such things into his head!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't know? It's arrogance!\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke the truth.\\n\\n\\\"Arrogance, Arrogance pure and simple--just as it was in Belshazzar,\\nor Sennacherib, or Nebuchadnezzar.\\\"\\n\\nHow thankful Walter was! If at this moment he had had a letter to\\nwrite--preferably to Femke--he would have boasted of being as wicked\\nas three old kings put together.\\n\\n\\\"Arrogance!\\\" repeated Juffrouw Laps. \\\"Gold on top, iron in the middle,\\nand feet of clay. The Master will overthrow him. Send him to me.\\\"\\n\\nThis invitation to turn over the royal villain to her for religious\\ninstruction was repeated so often that it was necessary to give her\\nan answer.\\n\\n\\\"But, dear Juffrouw, the boy don't want to. He's stubborn; and what\\ncan one do with such a child?\\\"\\n\\nWalter knew that his mother was not quite truthful; but, after his\\nformer experience with his friendly enemy, he found it desirable to\\nkeep quiet. When pressed, however, for an explanation he said:\\n\\n\\\"The man wanted snuff, and nobody would give him any; so I----\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps knew enough. Walter was as good as her prisoner: she\\nnow knew exactly how to take his fortifications, if they could be\\ntaken at all.\\n\\n\\\"If he doesn't want to come to me, don't compel him,\\\" she said sweetly\\non leaving. \\\"To force him won't do any good. Let him exercise his own\\npleasure. I'm afraid you pick at the child too much, anyway. What an\\nawful fuss we've made over a stiver!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I say, too,\\\" replied the mother. \\\"It looks as if we\\nbegrudged him the money! We could have spared another stiver, and we\\nwouldn't have missed it, would we, Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother, but it's time for Walter----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Goodness, what a hullaballoo to raise about a few pinches of\\nsnuff! The Master will repay it seven times seventy times. Whatever\\nye have done to the least of my brothers----\\\"\\n\\nWith this consoling passage on her lips she took her leave of the\\nastonished family.\\n\\nYes, it wasn't so easy to see through Juffrouw Laps!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\n\\nIn his efforts to reconcile the various conflicting authorities\\ncontesting for supremacy in his soul, Walter threw himself into a\\nsevere spell of blues. He was not conscious of the contrast between\\nthe world of his high-flown fancy and the earthy environment of his\\nhome-life. The sympathetic care which he should have received after\\nhis illness had not fallen to his lot.\\n\\nHe felt dejected.\\n\\n\\\"Femke!\\\" he thought; and he longed for her fresh healthy face,\\nfor her pure, unselfish glance, for her friendly smile. The Fancy\\nthat had led him away to the stars in search of his misty sister had\\ngot lodged on that girl of the Amsterdam lowlands, Femke--with her\\nunpoetical length, breadth, thickness, and weight.\\n\\n\\\"I am going to see her,\\\" he cried. \\\"I will! And if Mrs. Claus asks\\nme about worms a dozen times, it's all the same to me; I am going to\\nsee her!\\\"\\n\\nWalter reached the house and knocked. \\\"Come in!\\\" someone called. This\\nwas a little sudden, for it took some time to get hold of the\\nlatch. But Walter did it. Perhaps he was thinking of Missolonghi.\\n\\nThe Turks that he saw now were not revolting in appearance. They were\\nunarmed and did not murder a single baby.\\n\\nBut--Femke was not in the party.\\n\\nMrs. Claus was at the wash-tub, while Father Jansen was quietly\\nsmoking.\\n\\n\\\"Is that you, young man? Very nice! That's the young man who gave\\nFemke the picture, you remember, father?\\\"\\n\\nThe father nodded to him kindly and smoked away, without manifesting\\nany special Godliness.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Juffrouw, I wanted to----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very nice of you! Won't you have a slice of bread and butter? And how\\nis your mother? Is she better now? She was sick, wasn't she? That's\\na good boy, father. Femke said so. Is your mother better again? It\\nwas fever, wasn't it? or apoplexy--or what was it then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no! Juffrouw.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mustn't call me Juffrouw. I am only a wash-woman. Everyone must\\nstay in his own class, mustn't he, father? Well, it's all the better;\\nI thought she had been sick. It must have been somebody else. One\\nhas so much to think of. Do you like cheese?\\\"\\n\\nThe good woman prepared a slice of bread and butter, with cheese. If\\nTrudie could have seen it, she would have fainted. In the \\\"citizen's\\nclass,\\\" such and such a sub-class, according to Pennewip, is found\\na certain scantiness that does not obtain in the common laboring\\nclass. In the matter of eating, laborers, who do not invest their\\nmoney in Geneva, are not troubled so much by \\\"good form\\\" as people\\nwho give their children French names.\\n\\nWalter had never seen such a slice of bread. He didn't know whether he\\nought to bite through the width, or the thickness. The bit of cheese\\ngave him his cue.\\n\\nHe liked Mrs. Claus much better this time. And Father Jansen, too;\\neven if he wasn't like Walter had imagined him to be.\\n\\nHe had never conceived a preacher as being anything else but a very\\nsupernatural and spiritual and celestial sort of person. Father Jansen\\ndidn't seem to be that kind of a man at all.\\n\\nHe visited the sheep of his fold, especially the plain people, not\\nto make a display of beneficence--for he had nothing, but because he\\nwas happiest among simple people. He was fond of bread and butter of\\nthe Mrs. Claus variety. For the rest, he said mass, preached about\\nsin, catechised, confirmed, absolved, and did whatever needed to be\\ndone. He performed the functions of his office, and did not think\\nit at all strange that he should have gone into the church, while\\nhis brother in Nordbrabant succeeded to the business of his father,\\nwho was a farrier and inn-keeper.\\n\\n\\\"And what are you going to be?\\\" he asked Walter; \\\"for everybody in the\\nworld must be something. Wouldn't you like to be a bookbinder? That's\\na good trade.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was--I was in business, M'neer; and I'm going back to business.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's good, my boy. You may get rich. Especially here in Amsterdam;\\nfor Amsterdam is a commercial city.\\\"\\n\\nWalter wanted to add: \\\"The greatest commercial city of Europe.\\\" But\\nhe was abashed by the--worldliness of Father Jansen's talk. He didn't\\nfind it disagreeable: he was merely surprised at it.\\n\\n\\\"A boy like you ought to eat a lot. You look pale. My brother can bend\\na horseshoe. What do you say to that? Have you ever eaten our Brabant\\nbread? Ham isn't bad, either. A person that doesn't eat enough gets\\nweak. I always eat two slices of bread and butter whenever I'm here\\nat Mrs. Claus's; but I'm not nearly so strong as my brother. You\\nought to see the Vucht fair. That's a great time.\\\"\\n\\nWalter was more than surprised to hear such talk from a preacher: he\\nwas almost pleased. He had never received such charming messages from\\nheaven. Of course they came from heaven, those friendly words uttered\\nin Brabant dialect between the puffs of Father Jansen's pipe. This\\nman in a priest's coat chattered away as if there were no such thing\\nin the world as God, Grace, and Hell--especially the latter. He was\\nas happy as a child in telling about the strength of his brother,\\nthe horseshoer. It was his business to lead the world to eternal\\nhappiness; and he liked thick slices of bread and butter with cheese.\\n\\nWalter had never had religious things opened up to him so\\ndelightfully. He felt encouraged to speak:\\n\\n\\\"M'neer, I would like to know who God is!\\\"\\n\\nFather Jansen started, and looked at Walter as if he hadn't clearly\\nunderstood the question.\\n\\n\\\"Yes--that's very praiseworthy in you. You must----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, father,\\\" cried Mrs. Claus, \\\"the child isn't in the church! Are\\nyou?\\\"--to Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Juffrouw, I have been confirmed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To be sure, to be sure, but----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On the Noordermarkt!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you see he's in the church all right.\\\"\\n\\nThe good woman didn't have the heart--or else she had too much\\nheart--to tell the father that it wasn't the right church.\\n\\n\\\"Whoever wants to get acquainted with God,\\\" said Father Jansen,\\n\\\"must study diligently.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To be sure,\\\" said Mrs. Claus, \\\"the articles of faith. You ought to\\nhear my Femke repeat them. It's a pleasure, isn't it, father? She's\\nmy only child, but--she's a girl worth having!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Femke is an excellent girl. I don't have any trouble with her.\\\"\\n\\nThe father spoke in a business-like manner; and he meant it that\\nway. The spots on Femke's soul were easily removed. He praised Femke\\nas a cook would praise a kitchen-pot.\\n\\nFather Jansen had still more praise for Femke: she had patched his\\ndrawers so nicely.\\n\\nOh, Fancy!\\n\\nThe mention of this fact did not touch Walter's \\u00e6sthetic feelings. With\\nhim there were other considerations. Fancy was used to seeing\\neverything nude--fathers, humanity--so there was no difficulty here.\\n\\nWalter was sixteen years old, already a little man--why must Femke\\npatch drawers for this father!\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the mother. \\\"Femke is clever at patching. If you've got\\nanything else that needs mending, just send it over.\\\"\\n\\nWalter was warm. If it had been collars, socks, waistcoats, or--well,\\nif it had to be something questionable--if it had only been trousers!\\n\\n\\\"Just send it over, and if Femke isn't here----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is she going to be?\\\" thought Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Then I will attend to it myself. I can do it neatly.\\\"\\n\\nThank God! Dear, good, magnificent Mrs. Claus! Do it, do it yourself,\\nand leave Femke where she is.\\n\\nBut--where was she?\\n\\nThus Walter's thoughts; but what did he say?--the hypocrite, the\\nbudding man.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed, Mrs. Claus, I had almost forgotten to ask where your\\ndaughter Femke is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Femke? She's at my niece's, where the girl is sick. You know we're\\nof good family. Femke is looking after my niece's children.\\\"\\n\\nWalter didn't have the courage to ask where this niece lived, so he\\nassumed a look of contentment.\\n\\nAfter much waiting and twisting and turning on his chair, Walter\\nfinally left the house with Father Jansen. He had not yet learned\\nhow to end a visit: some people never learn it.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you want to do me a favor?\\\" said the good man. \\\"Then walk on\\nmy right side. I'm deaf here\\\"--pointing to his left ear.\\n\\n\\\"I will tell you how it happened. When I was a little boy--are you\\na good climber?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, M'neer!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I am! In the whole of Vucht there wasn't a boy who could\\nclimb as well as I could. Do you know what I did once? I climbed up\\nand slipped a flower-pot from a third-story window. And--my priest\\nwasn't in a good humor at all! He didn't want to accept me till I had\\nreturned that flower-pot; and then I had to go and beg the old woman's\\npardon. And she herself went to the priest to intercede for me. Then\\nhe accepted me. But I got twenty 'confiteors'--oh, he was severe!\\n\\n\\\"But I was going to tell you why I'm deaf in the left ear.\\n\\n\\\"In one of the seminaries was a student--he's a canonicus in the Rhine\\ncountry, and will get to be a cardinal, perhaps pope, for--he was\\nvery sly! I will tell you, his name was--Rake; but, you understand,\\nhis name was really something else. This Rake was a mean rascal; but he\\nwas never punished, because he was careful. See if he doesn't get to be\\na cardinal, or pope! You ought to hear him quote from the Vulgate. He\\ncould rattle away for three hours and never made a mistake.\\\" * * *\\n\\n\\\"Are you perfectly crazy, boy, or what is the matter with you? Walking\\nwith a priest! What in the name of the Lord are you thinking about? Go\\nin the house--quick! Jesu, what troubles I have with that child!\\\"\\n\\nWith these words Juffrouw Pieterse broke off Walter's acquaintance\\nwith Father Jansen for this time.\\n\\nThe way that the father and Walter had taken led them directly by\\nWalter's home. Juffrouw Pieterse, who was haggling with a Jew over the\\nprice of a basket of potatoes, narrowly escaped a stroke of apoplexy\\nwhen she saw them together.\\n\\n\\\"With a priest!--Stoffel! Come down quick--that boy is walking with\\na priest!\\\"\\n\\nTears rose in Walter's eyes. He had found Father Jansen a good man,\\nand was grieved that that gentleman should meet with such a reception.\\n\\nIt is to be hoped that those rude words were received by his left\\near. In fact, this seemed to be the case, for when Walter said that\\nhe was at home now and that his mother was calling him, Father Jansen\\nanswered kindly:\\n\\n\\\"So? You live there? Then I will tell you the next time why I am so\\ndeaf in my left ear--entirely deaf, you understand!\\\"\\n\\nThank God, Walter thought, and wiped away his tears. In his eyes his\\nmother had committed a sin so grave that about fifty \\\"confiteors\\\"\\nwould be necessary for its expiation.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes. I was going to tell you----\\\"\\n\\nWith these words Father Jansen turned around again. He continued:\\n\\\"The flower-pot of the old lady, Juffrouw Dungelaar, you know--it\\nwasn't for the flowers, you understand, nor for the pot, but only\\nbecause I could climb so well. Otherwise--one mustn't take anything\\naway, even if it is so high up. Adieu, young man!\\\"\\n\\nAfter giving Juffrouw Pieterse a friendly greeting that she did not\\ndeserve, the man continued on his way.\\n\\nStoffel said that to walk with a priest was \\\"simply preposterous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As if he were crazy!\\\" said Juffrouw Pieterse.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" agreed Stoffel, \\\"but it's because he has nothing to do but\\nloaf around. If that keeps up, he will never amount to anything.\\\"\\n\\nTrue, Walter was loafing around; but he was not idle. His activities\\nbrought nothing palpable to light, still he was building up the inner\\nlife in a manner of which Stoffel had no idea.\\n\\n\\\"Of course!\\\" said the mother. \\\"He must have work. If he were only\\nwilling to be a compositor! or an apprentice in the shoe-business. To\\nmake shoes--that he shall never do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This running with priests comes only from idleness, mother. Do I\\nrun with priests? Never. Why not? Because I have to go to my school\\nevery day!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Stoffel, you go to your school every day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Besides, there are good priests. There was Luther, for instance. He\\nwas a sort of priest. What did he do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I know. He reformed the people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He made them Lutherans, mother; but that's almost the same thing. One\\nmustn't be narrow-minded.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I say, Stoffel, people ought not to be so\\nnarrow-minded. What difference does it make what a person's religion\\nis, just so he's upright, and not a Roman Catholic!\\\"\\n\\nWhen Walter told Father Jansen that he \\\"was in business,\\\" and that\\nhe was \\\"going back to business,\\\" he spoke better than he himself\\nknew. He did go back to business.\\n\\nThrough a leather-dealer, who, speaking commercially, was in close\\ntouch with shoes that came from Paris, Walter got a position with a\\nfirm whose \\\"responsibility\\\" was somewhat less apocryphal than that of\\nMessrs. Motto, Business & Co. He was to begin his new apprenticeship\\nin the offices of Messrs. Ouwetyd & Kopperlith, a firm of world-wide\\nreputation.\\n\\nHowever, before he was to enter upon his new duties, all sorts of\\nthings were destined to happen, with the tendency to make Walter\\nappear as a \\\"hero of romance,\\\" which he wasn't at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\n\\nIt was Thursday. Stoffel came home with the important news that the\\nking--I don't know what king--had arrived in the city unexpectedly\\nand would visit the theatre that evening. Everything and everybody\\nwas in a commotion; for in republican countries much importance is\\ngiven to pomp and title.\\n\\nThis time curiosity was more wrought up than usual. Many foreign\\nprinces, including an emperor, were visiting the king; and these\\ndistinguished personages would follow the court to Amsterdam, coming\\nfrom The Hague, Utrecht and Haarlem. To put it tamely, it was to be\\na great occasion.\\n\\nThat republican populace was to get to see the countenance and\\ncoat-tails not only of their tyrant, but also the countenances and\\ncoat-tails of many other tyrants, not to mention female tyrants.\\n\\nThe old doughnut women on the \\\"Dam,\\\" which the city rented to them as\\na market-place, were threatening to bring suit against the city. They\\nfelt that it was hard to have to pay rent for the fresh air, day after\\nday, with the prospect of selling a few doughnuts to the youth of\\nthe street, and now be run out because his majesty wanted to exhibit\\nhimself to the people from the balcony of the old City Hall.\\n\\nWhy shouldn't the old women be seen at their accustomed places? Must\\nthe doughnut industry be carried on secretly? Was it for fear of\\nimitations and unprincely competition? Or was it to keep the old\\nwomen from seeing the king?\\n\\nAt any rate, the whole kit of them had to leave. At most, they could\\nonly mix with the crowd incognito, and afterwards might join in\\nthe prearranged \\\"Long live the King!\\\" or somebody else, as the case\\nmight be.\\n\\nIt is really remarkable that princes die. Seemingly the \\\"vivats\\\"\\nare of no avail.\\n\\nThe crowd was especially large, on account of the many majesties and\\nhighnesses who had gathered about the tyrant.\\n\\nAmong the number was the Prince of Caramania, who had especial claims\\nupon the sympathy of the people, so all the newspapers said. One of\\nhis ancestors had been a captain in the service of the state and had,\\ntherefore, spilt his blood for the freedom of the Netherlands.\\n\\nThis blood, and perhaps the freedom as well, was newspaper\\narabesque. It was certain, however, that the prince wore a green\\ncoat with gold frogs; and upon his head he had a big plume. It was,\\ntherefore, quite proper for the crowd to cry occasionally \\\"Long live\\nthe Prince of Caramania!\\\"\\n\\nAmong the eminent gentlemen was a certain duke, who, by reason of his\\nvirtues, had got himself banished from his country. The man was thrifty\\nand economical, though without neglecting himself. Nevertheless,\\nthe rabble had dethroned him and sent him across the border with a\\nbushel of diamonds. Of these diamonds he was now to display a few\\ndozen in the shape of coat-buttons and the like. The newspapers gave\\nthe crowd their cue accordingly. They were to cry: \\\"Long live the\\nDuke with his diamonds!\\\"\\n\\nPrincess Erika was the niece of the king, and was to marry the\\ncrown-prince of a great empire, which was indebted to the Netherlands\\nfor its prominence. The newspapers gave the assurance that this empire\\nwould pay off the national debt of the Netherlands if the people\\nwould only put enough enthusiasm into a \\\"Long live Princess Erika!\\\"\\n\\nThe old Countess-palatine of Aetolia was descended directly from\\na certain knight who treated his hostlers like princes. In this\\ncase it was not inappropriate for a republican populace to ask for\\na prolongation of her ladyship's life. The cry was: \\\"Long live the\\nCountess-palatine of Aetolia!\\\"\\n\\nThe Grand-duke of Ysland was the handsome grandson of a shopman. His\\nmerits would fill three columns of fine print. The man was a master\\nof the type-case himself, and by exerting himself could even set up\\nhis own name. The newspapers said that having safely passed an ocean\\nof pitfalls, he had now perfected himself as the brother-in-law of\\na demi-god. Therefore, whoever had the interest of his country at\\nheart could not afford to fail to bellow at the top of his voice:\\n\\\"Long live the Grand-duke of Ysland!\\\"\\n\\nThere were still more potentates and ladies of quality who had honored\\nAmsterdam with a visit. They had heard that the city was la V\\u00e9nise\\ndu Nord, that it was tres interessant, tres interessant! etc.\\n\\nAnd the Holland herrings! D\\u00e9licieux! Unfortunately the Netherlanders\\ndidn't know how to cook them; they must be baked.\\n\\nAnd the Holland school of painting! Rambr\\u00e0nn--magnifique!\\n\\nThere were still other good things in Holland, as their highnesses\\ntestified with patronizing kindness.\\n\\n\\\"Il parait qu'un certain Wond\\u00e8le a \\u00e9crit des choses, des choses--mais\\ndes choses--passablement bien!\\\"\\n\\nAnd the dikes! And the Katwyk sluice--gigantesque!\\n\\nWhatever spare time they might have after making cheese and cooking\\nherrings, the Holland people liked to devote to fighting the\\nelements. After skating and racing this was the favorite recreation\\nof the nation.\\n\\nI can assure the reader that the aristocratic party took their\\ndeparture thoroughly satisfied with our country. The only person who\\nreceived quite a different impression--but I will not anticipate the\\nfeelings of our hero. Even a writer has his duties.\\n\\nThe first evening everything was to be illuminated. Two hundred\\nand fifty thousand candles were to proclaim the enthusiasm of the\\npeople. Two hundred and fifty thousand fiery tongues were to cry:\\n\\\"Hosanna! Blessed be he who comes in the name of----\\\" In whose\\nname? Hosanna for whom? For what?\\n\\nWell, that was a matter of indifference to the people. They knew\\nthat there was something doing, that there was a crowd, and that\\nwas enough. People are somewhat like children, who amuse themselves\\nimmensely in the confusion of a \\\"moving,\\\" of a death, or of anything\\nthat causes commotion and excitement.\\n\\nWalter had got permission to see the illumination. Unconsciously\\nhe assumed that stupid expression which is obligatory on such\\noccasions. He listened to the conversation of those about him.\\n\\n\\\"That's what I call illuminating! Nine candles for such a big house!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Twelve!\\\" cried another.\\n\\n\\\"No, nine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Twelve!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nine!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Three--three--three--and three. Look there are twelve, or I can't\\ncount.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, the three above don't count. That story is rented. I know it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well--if you mean it that way. I only said that four times three\\nare twelve. What do you say, Hannes?\\\"\\n\\nHannes found the calculation correct.\\n\\n\\\"How long will the candles burn?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Till about one o'clock, I suppose.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe it!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I don't!----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you been in the Sukkelgracht?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it isn't pretty there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You think so? Prettier than here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is!----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look there; there's a verse.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, a verse. Can you read it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly! Let me see, what is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can read it, too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's about 'illustrious blood'----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and 'our country,' and 'dedicated to honor and virtue.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And 'his illustrious blood'----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, there it stands--'torn from the barbarians'----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That comes later. 'Illustrious blood'----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of Holland's hero----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Welcome, hero!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if the king looks at the candles. Do you suppose he reads\\nsuch verses and copies them?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, he has his ministers for that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or generals. He has seen or read about lots of nice things.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As nice as here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, of course!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know what I think? He likes to look at the lights too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You think so?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, you don't believe that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't crowd so!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't help it. They're crowding me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The people are pushing and shoving as if they were crazy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you ever see the like? You know what I think? Kalver Street\\nought to be as wide again as it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, as wide again. The street's too narrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's why everybody's scroudging so.\\\"\\n\\nThere was much truth in this. Pressure was high. People were mashed\\nand squeezed together. Those who, by reason of a lack of avoirdupois,\\nwere less firmly attached to the ground, were lifted bodily. Walter\\nhung suspended in mid-air and looked over the heads of men much taller\\nthan he.\\n\\n\\\"Are you walking on stilts?\\\" asked a big fat woman, whose hips had\\ncome into collision with Walter's knees. \\\"Well, that's something.\\\"\\n\\nThe pressure was increasing. It seemed that the fat woman would soon\\nhave Walter on her shoulder, like a gun; while Walter was thinking\\nthat soon he would be roaming over the country like a knight. No one\\nwas looking at the candles now. People were finding their amusement\\nin crowding and being crowded.\\n\\nNo, Kalver Street ought not to be widened. For, properly understood,\\nthis crowding and pushing and shoving was the nicest part of the\\nwhole business.\\n\\nHow tedious it would have been quietly to watch those two hundred\\nand fifty thousand candles from some comfortable position.\\n\\nOur little man lay on the heads and shoulders of his brothers. Like\\nsome aspirants to a throne, he threw himself upon the masses. But he\\nwas beginning to feel generally uncomfortable. He wanted to hold on\\nfast to something, or somebody--to somebody's ears, or nose. That,\\nhowever, did not suit the masses. They didn't mind being squeezed;\\nbut they didn't like to be held on to.\\n\\nCrash!\\n\\nDon't let the reader be alarmed. Walter had not burst under the strain;\\nbut the pressure of the crowd had broken in the double doors of a\\ncaf\\u00e9! The irruption was terrible. The way the crowd streamed in might\\nbe compared to the flow of molten lava. Walter described a parabolic\\ncurve and landed on a table, without suffering any damage.\\n\\n\\\"Walter Pieterse!\\\" cried the astonished party sitting around the table.\\n\\n\\\"Have you hurt yourself, Walter?\\\"\\n\\nNo, he hadn't hurt himself; but he was rigid with surprise. Firstly,\\nover his ascent; secondly, over his a\\u00ebrial journey; then over his\\ndescent among all kinds of glassware; and, finally--and that was not\\nthe least surprising thing--he was surprised to find himself all at\\nonce in the bosom of the Holsma family.\\n\\nIt was Sietske who asked him if he was hurt.\\n\\nAll the glasses, both great and small, were broken; but Walter was\\nstill in one piece. Uncle Sybrand helped him to his feet. It wasn't\\neasy, for the press was great. However, Walter's size facilitated\\nmatters.\\n\\nThe proprietor couldn't reach the scene of action, but he was able\\nto make his voice heard to the effect that everything broken must be\\npaid for. From other tables came the noise of more breaking glass. The\\nman was desperate. He cursed kings and masses indiscriminately.\\n\\n\\\"One bottle of wine, three lemonades, six glasses!\\\" cried Holsma,\\nassuming the responsibility for Walter's unintentional work of\\ndestruction.\\n\\nUncle Sybrand was holding up the money to pay for everything.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, M'neer, I'm afraid to go home after this,\\\" cried Walter. \\\"How\\ncan I pay for that? And my mother----\\\"\\n\\nIn the noise and jumble Holsma did not understand; but Sietske\\nunderstood.\\n\\n\\\"Sh!\\\" she whispered. \\\"Papa will pay for it all. Besides, I have money;\\nand William, too; and Hermann. Just be quiet.\\\"\\n\\nWalter still did not understand. When, under the protection of the\\nHolsmas, he was safe on the outside again, and the entire party had\\nescaped the mob by taking a side street, he reiterated that he did\\ndare show his face to his mother and Stoffel.\\n\\n\\\"It doesn't make any difference about the money,\\\" said Holsma. \\\"I\\nwill attend to that. Why, boy, you're scared half to death. You're\\nshaking. Come along home with us where you can rest a bit and quiet\\nyourself.\\\"\\n\\nThe distance, however, proved too short to have the desired quieting\\neffect on Walter.\\n\\n\\\"My mother will be angry when I come home late.\\\"\\n\\nHolsma told him that a messenger should be sent to his mother at once,\\nso that she would know where he was.\\n\\nThe doctor gave him a sedative and led him into a room adjoining that\\nin which the Holsma family were sitting. Walter was to walk up and\\ndown the room till he felt better; but he soon got tired of this and\\ndid the very thing that he was not to do; he sat down on a sofa and\\nfell asleep.\\n\\nWhether, in general, it is a good thing to keep in motion after a\\nfright--that I do not know. Walter, on the contrary, always felt the\\nneed of sleep under such circumstances; and this remedy, with which\\nnature provided him, usually restored his mental equilibrium. Perhaps,\\nafter all, it wasn't real sleep: he merely dreamed.\\n\\nAgain he was lifted up, higher and higher, borne by strong hands. A\\nman bit him in the hand. The fact was he had scratched his hand on\\na refractory horsehair, which had become tired of acting as stuffing\\nfor a sofa-pillow.\\n\\nAn angry woman assailed him with abuse. Stupid? Not stupid? We, the\\nmasses? She let him fall. But he fell in Sietske's lap; and there\\nwasn't a single sliver of glassware.\\n\\nHe was happy--but the horsehair scratched him again. Then he heard\\na voice. Was he still dreaming? Yes, dreaming again of soaring and\\nfalling. There was Femke.\\n\\nOf course there had to be something about her in his dream, and about\\nbleaching the clothes. Father Jansen was there, too, exhibiting to\\nthe stars the particular garment that Femke had patched. Orion and\\nthe Great Bear admired this specimen of her handiwork. Walter did not.\\n\\n\\\"Did you do it yourself?\\\" he heard Sietske asking in the next room. \\\"Or\\ncouldn't you get through the crowd?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, it was impossible to get through such a mob. I turned it over\\nto the man with the peddler's wagon.\\\"\\n\\nWhat was that? Walter sat up. Father Jansen was gone; Orion, too;\\nand the clouds, and the \\\"masses\\\"; but--that voice!\\n\\nHe heard it again.\\n\\n\\\"I know him very well--oh, so well! He's a good boy.\\\" This he heard\\nFemke say!\\n\\nHe jumped up and ran into the room where the Holsmas were. He saw\\na triangular piece of a woman's dress disappear through the door;\\nthen the door closed.\\n\\nHe didn't have the courage--or was something else beside courage\\nnecessary to ask, \\\"Is that Femke?\\\"\\n\\nOn his way home that evening Walter did not suffer in the least\\nfrom the sensation of being borne through the air; or from anything\\nsimilar. He was on the earth, very much on the earth. He felt lowly.\\n\\nIf he had only seen that bit of Femke's dress somewhere else, and\\nnot at the Holsmas--not in that swell family; not in the company\\nof Sietske, who had so much money in her \\\"savings-bank,\\\" nor in the\\npresence of the vain William, who was studying Latin!\\n\\nHe was brave enough to feel ashamed of himself; and that's all I can\\nsay in his favor.\\n\\nLet us now look at things from the point of view of Juffrouw\\nPieterse. That lady was in the clouds. She was hoping that the\\nmessenger who had brought her news of Walter had not been able to\\nfind her flat at once. The idea of someone from Dr. Holsma's asking\\nfor her through the neighborhood was decidedly pleasant. The longer\\nhe might have had to inquire for her the better!\\n\\n\\\"Of course he was at the grocer's,\\\" she said. \\\"Such messengers\\nnever know where they have to go. Of course he told that the 'young\\ngentleman' was staying at Dr. Holsma's! And such a man always\\ntattles; such people don't do anything but tattle. But, as far as\\nI'm concerned, everybody can know it. I only mean that such people\\nlike to tattle. But--say, Walter, how did it happen that you went\\nwith the family? You're a nice rascal. Stoffel, what do you say?\\\"\\n\\nStoffel made a serious face--as much as to say: \\\"Hm! I'll have to\\nthink over it. He's been up to something.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I met the Holsma family in Kalver Street,\\\" Walter said. He told\\nthe truth; he had met the family in Kalver Street. But why didn't he\\ntell anything about the extraordinary circumstances under which he\\nmet them? Ah--there's the rub!\\n\\n\\\"Your back is so sticky!\\\" complained Pietro, whose care it was to\\nlook after the washing.\\n\\nThe family rubbed, and felt, and smelt; and then they declared\\nunanimously that Walter's back had been guilty of absorbing all kinds\\nof sticky gases and liquids.\\n\\n\\\"Really, it smells like lemon,\\\" said Trudie.\\n\\n\\\"And like wine!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And it's just coated with sugar. Boy, where have you been? Don't\\nyou have any sense of shame? To go to visit such swell people with\\nlemon and sugar on your back! It's a disgrace, a disgrace.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There was such a crowd on the street.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That don't explain the wine on your back--nor the lemon--nor the\\nsugar. What say you, Trudie?\\\"\\n\\nThere was complete unanimity. Timid, as usual, Walter didn't have the\\ncourage to tell everything. Nor would this have done any good. The\\nunderstanding of the Pieterse family was like a rusty lock that no key\\nwill open. Walter knew this, and remembering former sad experiences,\\nallowed the storm to rage above his head. Unfortunately he, too,\\nin a sense, was rusty. His nobility of character had suffered; he\\nhad been guilty of cowardice.\\n\\nHe felt it. No minister could pray it away. Not even God himself\\ncould revoke it. Everyone must act according to his conviction,\\nMevrouw Holsma had said. He had not done this.\\n\\nA dog would have kissed the hem of Femke's garment, meeting her after\\nsuch a long separation. For it was she. Certainly it was Femke--or----\\n\\nOh, he was hunting for or's!\\n\\nCould it have been somebody else? It must have been somebody else. How\\ncould Femke be at Dr. Holsma's?\\n\\nNo, no, it was she! Didn't she say that she knew me? Didn't she speak\\nwith the same voice that I heard when she called me a dear boy and\\ngave me the kiss at the bridge?\\n\\nShe didn't know then what a coward I am! She wouldn't deny me and\\nbetray me. She would say to everybody: That is Walter, my little\\nfriend that I kissed that time, because he was so brave in fighting\\noff those boys!\\n\\nAnd I? Oh, help me God!\\n\\nNo, God has nothing to do with it. I am a coward. I can't live\\nthis way.\\n\\nHe thought of suicide; and in this mood he spent that Thursday\\nnight. He arose Friday morning with the firm determination to put an\\nend to his unworthy existence.\\n\\nFortunately, just after breakfast he was put to work on a job that\\nis calculated to reconcile one with life.\\n\\nHe had been tried and convicted, the verdict being unanimous. The\\npenalty was that he should wash his jacket till it was clean. He\\nentered upon the task with such enthusiasm that in an hour he was\\nrunning to his mother crying triumphantly:\\n\\n\\\"Look, mother! You can't see a trace of it now!\\\"\\n\\nThis little conquest dispelled all the clouds that had darkened\\nhis life.\\n\\nThere are plenty of people who would gladly fall into a barrel of\\nlemonade if they only understood the salutary effects of cleaning\\na coat.\\n\\nThe poor unfortunate who has never washed his own clothes does not\\nknow what life is.\\n\\nI will ask her pardon, thought Walter; and he pictured it all\\nto himself, wondering whether it would do for him to fall at her\\nfeet at Holsma's, in the presence of the one who had delivered the\\nmessage. Finally, however, he quieted himself with the thought that\\nFemke would probably not be at the doctor's very long. He hoped to be\\nable then to settle the matter quietly, when only the two concerned\\nwere present. This was not courageous, to be sure; but his punishment\\nwas already on the way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n\\nThe events of an eventful Friday were at an end, as it seemed; and\\nWalter prepared to climb into the narrow bedstead, which he shared with\\nhis brother Laurens. He was now in a tranquil frame of mind. He didn't\\neven have any desire to romp with Laurens, who, without laying claim to\\ngeometrical knowledge, usually managed to find the diagonal of the bed.\\n\\nIt was Walter's intention to think over recent events again. He wished\\nto busy himself with others; he was tired of himself--at least he\\nthought so for a moment.\\n\\nThere was a prince, who distributed money among the people. Oh,\\nif I were only a prince!\\n\\nThat wasn't a bad thought. Under the same circumstances, most people\\nwould have thought: Oh, if I could only have got some of the money!\\n\\nThe countess-palatine from--where from? Well it makes no\\ndifference. She was in the museum and the papers said she was gracious,\\nvery gracious.\\n\\nI would do it too, thought Walter, if I were a countess-palatine. What\\nsort of a profession is that?\\n\\nThe king had given audiences--and a dinner--and had said--well, the\\nusual things. But for Walter it was new and interesting. The welfare of\\nthe city seemed to lie heavily on his majesty's heart. It lay heavily\\non Walter's heart, too; but that did not prevent Walter from admiring\\nthis peculiarity of the king. In Africa he would do the same thing.\\n\\nNo, away with Africa!\\n\\nHe threw off his left stocking so violently that it curled around\\nthe leg of the chair like a dying earthworm.\\n\\nWhat strange things he had heard of Princess Erika! It was said that\\nshe was to have married a grand-duke, but rejected him.\\n\\nThe middle classes were delighted with this news; though not knowing\\nbut that it might merely have been stubbornness on the part of the\\nprincess.\\n\\nShe was of such a strange nature that she did not know how to behave\\nherself in her high position.\\n\\nWalter slipped off his other stocking, finding fault with the princess\\nfor disregarding the usual customs and conventions. Hm! He wondered\\nif she would like to change places with him, and let him be Prince\\nErich--and she----\\n\\nHe wondered if she too wore an ugly nightcap. But--no! Princesses\\nwould wear caps of diamonds.\\n\\nPrincess Erika!\\n\\nWalter blew out the light--no, he was on the point of blowing it\\nout. He had selected one of the triangles that Laurens had described\\nin the bed, when suddenly he became aware of a great tumult in the\\nPieterse home.\\n\\nYes, somebody had rung violently three or four times and was still\\nbanging at the door. Fire?\\n\\nHm! Could it be Princess Erika, he thought, who was coming to change\\nplaces with him?\\n\\nAlas, it was only Juffrouw Laps; and she did not come to exchange.\\n\\nWell, what did she want then, so late in the evening?\\n\\nWalter pulled himself together and listened.\\n\\nThe compartment where Walter and Laurens slept was a boxed-up\\narrangement over the sitting-room. Two of their sisters shared the\\nspace with them. From considerations of modesty, therefore, the boys\\nalways had to get sleepy a quarter of an hour before the young ladies.\\n\\nThe writer is unable to say how much oxygen four young people need\\nduring eight hours without suffocating; but anyway there wasn't much\\nroom in this little nook.\\n\\nIn another closet-affair there was a similar division, and here, too,\\nthe hour for retiring was determined by similar laws of modesty.\\n\\nThe reader will now understand why a part of the family, the female\\npart of course, was still in the sitting-room when Walter imagined\\nthat Princess Erika had come to exchange places with him.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps, who had rushed up the steps like a crazy woman, burst\\ninto the room weeping and moaning and sobbing.\\n\\nThe usual cries of, \\\"What on earth is the matter?\\\" \\\"Lord 'a'\\nmercy--what has happened?\\\" were forthcoming. Walter noticed, too, that\\nthe customary glass of water was offered and drunk, and that proper\\nefforts were being made to get the unhappy one to \\\"calm herself.\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps began her story with the positive assurance that it\\nwas impossible for her to utter a word.\\n\\nIt seemed, therefore, that the affair was something important. Walter\\npulled on one of his stockings and prepared to listen.\\n\\n\\\"I swear, Juffrouw Pieterse, by the omnipotent God, that I'm so\\nfrightened and excited that I can't talk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Goodness!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where are your children? In bed? Not all of them, I hope. Really,\\nI can't speak. Give me another glass of water, Trudie. Listen, how\\nmy teeth are chattering. That comes from fright, doesn't it? I'm in\\na tremble all over. Thank you, Trudie. Where's--Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's undressing,\\\" said Juffrouw Pieterse. \\\"He goes to bed before\\nme and Pietro. Mina makes so much noise, you know; and Trudie must\\nstay with the boys to keep them from fighting. That's why I sleep\\nwith Pietro, you see. Stoffel undresses himself, and then he draws\\nthe curtain when he hears us on the steps. But why----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How that concerns me, you mean? To be sure. I'm just beside myself\\nfrom fright! And is--Laurens in bed too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course! A long time already. He has to go to the printing-house\\nearly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All in bed! And I--I run through the streets, wretched, crazy,\\nand don't know what to do. Is everybody in bed?--everybody?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But what has happened?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm going to tell you, Juffrouw Pieterse. Oh, if you only knew how\\nfrightened I am!\\\"\\n\\nConsideration of acoustics now led Walter to put on his other stocking.\\n\\n\\\"You know, Juffrouw Pieterse, that of late so much stealing has been\\ngoing on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And burglary and murder! And the police can't catch anybody. You know\\nthe old woman and the servant-girl who were murdered in Lommer Street.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But three are already behind the bars for it. What more do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's all right; the murderers are running around scot-free. They've\\nlocked up three fellows just to keep the people from thinking too\\nmuch. They don't want anybody to ask, 'What are the police for?' You\\nsee what I mean? I tell you that such a low-down rascal, who commits\\na murder and steals lots of money, cannot hide his bloody clothes;\\nnor the money, either. He's not used to having so much money. All\\nthe neighbors know his coat and breeches; and such a man hasn't any\\ntrunk where he can hide his things. He doesn't know how to manage with\\ndrafts and notes; and he don't know enough to get away to a foreign\\ncountry. As for friends to help him get rid of the stolen things,\\nhe hasn't any. I tell you, Juffrouw Pieterse, a murder or a robbery,\\nwhen they don't catch the murderer right away--then some respectable\\nperson has done it, who has more clothes and boxes and presses and\\nlinen--and he has friends among bankers. A common fellow would stick\\na hundred thousand florins in the bread-box, and the children would\\nfind it when they went to slip a slice of bread and butter. What do\\nyou say, Trudie?\\\"\\n\\nTrudie was not versed in criminal statistics and had never reflected\\non the matter. At least Walter heard no answer. Curiosity compelled\\nhim to draw on his trousers.\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" he heard his mother saying again, \\\"what has happened to you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What has happened? I am beside myself. Don't you see how I'm\\ntrembling? The city is full of murderers!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My goodness! How can I help it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You can't. But I am beside myself, and I want to ask your advice. Do\\nthey all go to bed so early?--Stoffel--and Laurens--all of them? Look,\\nhow I'm shaking. Do you suppose I dare go back to my room?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not? Do you think you're going to be murdered?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. I do think it! The murderers of that old woman and of the\\nservant-girl are still on the war-path. Yesterday at the illumination\\nhow many watches did they steal? And the police--what do they\\ndo? Nothing, nothing! Yes, they watch you to see if you beat a rug\\nin the morning after ten o'clock. That's what the police do. They\\ndon't bother murderers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you know about the murderers? It's your duty to report them\\nif you know them.\\\"\\n\\nWalter put on his vest and wrapped his muffler around his neck.\\n\\n\\\"What I know about them! They are besieging me in my own house. Isn't\\nthat pretty rough? I went out at noon to see the boat race on the\\nAmstel; but there was nothing to see, because there was no wind. And\\nsuch a crowd! All the kings were there, and the visiting princes\\nand princesses, you know; and everybody stared at the carriages,\\nand I did too. Not that I care anything about a king. Goodness,\\nno! For he is only a worm in God's hand, and when the Master doesn't\\naid him--all is vanity, vanity. Dust and ashes--that's all. But I\\nlooked at the carriages, you know, and at the horses, and at the\\nstaring crowd. I thought to myself, I will fry the potatoes when I\\ngo home. They had been left over from dinner; and when there are any\\npotatoes left over, you know, I always fry them for supper. There was\\na big crowd, and all were mad because there was no wind; for people\\nare foolish about pleasure and never think of the Master. Worldly,\\nworldly, they were--and the princes and princesses. I thought, well,\\nit's no wonder that there's so much robbery and murder; for they try\\nGod's patience. I thought, God will punish you; He's only abiding\\nHis time. He always does it, Juffrouw Pieterse! A lady--the creature\\nhad red pimples on her face, and was older than you--what do you\\nsuppose she had on her head? A turban! She rode in a carriage with\\nfour horses. What do you think of that? She was playing with a fan;\\nand, when a prince rode up to her carriage, she stuck out her hand\\nand let the fan go up and down three times. And the prince did that\\nway three times. Were they crazy, or not? What will the Master say\\nto that? If He only doesn't send a pestilence on us!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but the murderers--what did they do to you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, certainly--what they did? I am going to tell you. I'm still\\ntrembling. I had sliced my potatoes, put them on a saucer and set\\nthem away in the cupboard. Then I thought, I will fry them when I come\\nhome; for I didn't expect to stay long in the crowd, for I have been\\nsaved by grace and don't care for worldly things--ah, dear Juffrouw\\nPieterse, you must call Stoffel, so he can hear what has happened.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel was already on his way down; and Walter was glad of it. Walter\\nhad heard the noise Stoffel was making putting on his clothes in the\\nadjoining booth, and upon this he builded hopes that he too might\\nbe allowed to go down, where he could hear the exciting story better\\nthan was possible through the cracks in the floor. In the meantime he\\nhad completely dressed himself. The noises below told him of Stoffel's\\narrival in the sitting-room. He heard the usual greetings and Juffrouw\\nLaps's solemn assurance that she was still in such a tremble that\\nshe couldn't say a word. Then he heard her ask immediately where\\nLaurens was.\\n\\nLaurens? Well, he was asleep.\\n\\nThat youth's absence seemed to trouble the visitor. She couldn't\\nproceed. Was it really necessary for Laurens to be present?\\n\\n\\\"What do you say, Stoffel? Isn't the city full of thieves and\\nmurderers?\\\"\\n\\nStoffel drew in his upper lip and tried to make the lower one touch\\nhis nose. Let the reader try the same; then he will know how Stoffel\\nanswered, and what his answer meant.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps pretended to believe that he had said \\\"yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see, Stoffel says so too! The city is full of thieves and\\nmurderers, and--a respectable person is afraid to go to bed alone\\nany more. It's just that way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But--Juffrouw!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The police? Nonsense! What good do the police do, when people\\ndon't believe in God? That's the truth. Whoever doesn't do that is\\nlost. Human help--I cannot understand at all why Laurens goes to bed so\\nearly. You surely know that so much sleep isn't good for anybody. What\\ndoes the Bible say? Watch and pray! But--everyone according to his\\nnotion. I swear before God that I don't dare to go home alone and----\\\"\\n\\nWalter's curiosity was at high tension. In order to hear better he\\nwas leaning over, supporting himself with the chair. The point of\\nsupport was unsteady. The chair slipped and rattled across the floor,\\ncrashing into another piece of furniture.\\n\\n\\\"Heaven and earth! What are they up to now,\\\" groaned the\\nmother. \\\"Laurens, is that you?\\\"\\n\\nWalter peeped in, \\\"It was me.\\\" The result was that he was soon in the\\nmidst of the interesting conversation that he had been trying to hear\\nfrom above.\\n\\nHis entrance took place under unfavorable circumstances. He was blamed\\nfor not having been undressed.\\n\\n\\\"Do you always put on your nightcap before you undress?\\\" cried\\nthe mother.\\n\\nThe boy had actually forgotten to take off his nightcap. He was so\\nashamed that he felt he would like to fall through the floor. He\\nwould rather have neglected anything else.\\n\\n\\\"And--what have you there?\\\"\\n\\nAlas, our hero looked more ridiculous than anyone could look by simply\\nputting on a nightcap. He had armed himself with an old rusty knife\\nthat his father had used in prehistoric times for cutting leather!\\n\\nDuring the whole of the Laps recital, which progressed so slowly,\\nhe had thought and hoped and intended--yes, he heard something that\\nsounded like, \\\"Where is Walter?\\\" The speaker really did not say it--no,\\non the contrary, those were the very words she wished to avoid--still,\\nhe thought he heard her say them. On this Friday he had acted mean\\nand cowardly; but he was still Walter.\\n\\nMurderers? Thieves? A lady in danger? What other answer could there\\nbe but: \\\"I am here, I, Walter!\\\"\\n\\nOh, fate, why did you put that sword in his hand and let him forget\\nto remove that nightcap? Why didn't you divide these two absurdities\\nbetween Stoffel and Walter! Or why couldn't you put that feathery\\ndiadem on the head of the sleeping Laurens? It would have been all\\nthe same to him how he looked in his sleep.\\n\\nWalter was in a rage.\\n\\nAnd I am, too. Towards Femke his chivalry had remained in the\\nbackground; and now it must burst forth at a doubtful call from\\nJuffrouw Laps!\\n\\nIn his anger he threw the weapon down violently and allowed it to\\nrebound across the room. He slapped the nightcap on the table.\\n\\nNo one would have thought that the little man could be so vehement. His\\nmother, with her usual solicitousness, inquired into the condition\\nof his mind, asking if he was only cracked, or downright crazy.\\n\\n\\\"I tell you,\\\" said the visitor, \\\"you ought not to worry that child\\nso much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go to bed at once!\\\" cried the mother.\\n\\n\\\"Why can't you let the child stay here? But--oh, yes! I was going to\\ntell you about my potatoes.\\\"\\n\\nWalter stayed. For this privilege he was indebted to the general\\ncuriosity.\\n\\n\\\"Just imagine, when I came home about half past ten o'clock--I couldn't\\nget away earlier on account of the crush, you know. Don't you know,\\nI don't care for these big occasions. Well, when I got home--the city\\nis full of thieves, murderers, and that must not be forgotten--well,\\nmy potatoes were--what do you think my potatoes were? They were--gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your potatoes--gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My potatoes--all completely gone!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell you those thieves and murderers did it. Who else could have\\ndone it? Thieves and murderers in my house! And I wanted to ask\\nyou--for I'm afraid in my room----\\\"\\n\\nWalter's eyes fairly shone.\\n\\n\\\"I wanted to ask, if perhaps--your son Stoffel----\\\"\\n\\nStoffel's face was a study, a curiosity. If the said thieves and\\nmurderers could have seen it they would have been greatly pleased,\\nfor it bore evidence of Stoffel's intention to leave them undisturbed\\nin their work.\\n\\n\\\"But, Juffrouw,\\\" he said, \\\"haven't you a cat in your room?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A cat? A cat to fight murderers with!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Juffrouw, not to fight murderers; but a cat that might have\\neaten the potatoes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know anything about a cat. I only know that the city is\\nfull of low-down people when so many murders are committed and no one\\ntries to catch the murderers. Not that I am anxious about my life--no,\\nnot at all. When the Master calls me I shall say, 'Let thy daughter\\ngo in peace; my eyes have seen thy glory.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, woman, why didn't you look in your closet, and under the bed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't want to do that, Juffrouw Pieterse! The Lord will take care\\nof me--but one must not try the Lord's patience. I would not go in the\\ncloset, or look under the bed--not for everything in the world! For of\\ncourse he's there, and that's why I wanted to ask if your son--Stoffel,\\nor, if Stoffel doesn't want to, if perhaps your son--Laurens, or----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Juffrouw, why didn't you call the neighbors?\\\"\\n\\nThus spoke Stoffel.\\n\\n\\\"The neighbors? Well, I guess they know about it. The man who lives\\nunder me is afraid of a poodle-dog, not to mention a murderer. There's\\na man living next to me; but, you know, he is--what shall I say--he\\nis a sort of bachelor, and I don't want to get talked about. You\\nknow a woman must always think of her reputation, and not get mixed\\nup in gossip.\\\"\\n\\nIt did not occur to anyone to ask what sort of a creature Stoffel\\nwas. Was he a bachelor? Or did his position as a teacher protect him\\nagainst any worldly suspicion?\\n\\n\\\"And, besides,\\\" continued the seductive Laps, \\\"do you think all\\nmen have courage? No! They're as afraid of a thief as they are of\\ndeath. Last week an insolent beggar was on the steps, and the fellow\\nwouldn't leave. Do you think the men did anything to him? Scared to\\ndeath! But, I tell you, I got hold of him in a hurry and----\\\"\\n\\nShe had gone too far, and she saw it.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I would have done that if I hadn't been a woman; for a woman\\nmust never use violence. It isn't becoming. What do you say, Trudie? I\\nran and shut my door. Wasn't that right? No, none of the men-folk\\nhas any courage!\\\"\\n\\nNone of the men-folk! Walter felt insulted. He was swelling with\\nsuppressed courage; he was eager for a fray. At least, he was eager to\\nshow that he was an exception to Juffrouw Laps's general indictment. Of\\ncourse Juffrouw Laps noticed this.\\n\\n\\\"Well, if Stoffel doesn't want to----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To tell the truth, I----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And if Laurens is already asleep--and if--if no one else will----\\\"\\n\\nShe arose.\\n\\n\\\"Then I suppose I must, relying upon God, go alone. But it's horrible\\nfor a woman to be entirely alone!\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at them all in turn, all except the one she was talking\\nto. Walter felt that he was being forgotten, or overlooked. This only\\nincreased his latent courage and made him burn with a desire to be\\nnumbered with the knighthood of the house.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, if there's nobody here who's not afraid----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not afraid!\\\"\\n\\nAll but Juffrouw Laps were surprised. She was a good psychologist,\\nand had not expected anything else. It was her part, however, to\\npretend to be as much surprised as any of the rest.\\n\\n\\\"You?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You, Walter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Boy, are you crazy? You?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I. I'm not afraid; not if there were ten in the closet and a\\nhundred under the bed!\\\"\\n\\nA little Luther! But with a difference. Luther had a God in whom\\nhe felt he could trust--reinforced by a few grand-dukes. Walter,\\nwithout any grand-dukes, was ready to enter the field against a God\\nwho was allowing any number of murderers to take shelter under the\\nroof and bed of Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\n\\\"Boy!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll risk it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let him go, Juffrouw Pieterse. You understand--it's company for me\\nto have such a child with me. Then I'm not frightened so badly, if a\\nmurderer is in the closet. Nobody wants to be entirely alone. Isn't\\nthat so?\\\"\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps gained her point: Walter was permitted to go with her.\\n\\nIt was principally their vanity that caused the Pieterses to consent\\nso readily to Juffrouw Laps's request and allow her to take Walter\\naway to act as her castellan. Not one of them felt that it was a\\ngood thing for Walter to go with the Juffrouw; but they were all\\nproud of his courage. The story would get noised abroad, and people\\nwould pass it on to their friends. Juffrouw Pieterse would see to\\nit that the people knew it was \\\"the same young gentlemen, you know,\\nthat went home with Dr. Holsma.\\\"\\n\\nYes, and then people would say: \\\"There's something in those Pieterse\\nchildren.\\\"\\n\\nMothers like to hear such things.\\n\\nWith his package under his arm Walter marched away with Juffrouw\\nLaps to do battle for that pious lady. That prehistoric weapon he\\nleft behind, on her assuring him that she had a well-filled store\\nof weapons and ammunition enough to kill all the murderers that he\\nwould have occasion to contend with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\n\\nWalter shuddered as he crossed Juffrouw Laps's threshold. He reflected,\\nand wondered how he could have entered upon this knightly expedition\\nwithout considering certain details connected with it and inseparable\\nfrom it.\\n\\nThe first thing she offered him, of course, was the fried potatoes,\\nthat dainty dish which the murderers had greedily made away with!\\n\\nWalter was beginning to feel that the game wasn't worth the candle. The\\nadventure didn't offer sufficient outlet for his chivalry. In fact,\\nhe thought something other than chivalry was necessary to face\\nsingle-handed and alone those fried potatoes and Juffrouw Laps's\\npersistent attentions.\\n\\n\\\"Make yourself at home and eat all you want. Don't be a bit\\nembarrassed. Or would you rather take off your coat first? You know,\\nyou're to stay all night with me.\\\"\\n\\nWalter preferred to keep on his coat for the present.\\n\\n\\\"And I have a dram for you, too, my boy--something extra. It's\\nfrom Fockink's. You know where he has his distillery, there in that\\nnarrow street. You must never pass along there. Bad women live in\\nthat street. They stand at the doors and windows, don't you know;\\nand that isn't good for a bachelor like you.\\\"\\n\\nWalter, the \\\"bachelor,\\\" looked surprised. He was abashed; though he\\nwas not displeased. This promotion was more flattering than going into\\n\\\"business.\\\"\\n\\nStill, he was embarrassed. Juffrouw Laps found it desirable, therefore,\\nto continue along this line.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, Walter, you're a bachelor. Don't you know that? It's only\\nbecause at home they treat you like a child. I tell you, you're a\\nbachelor, just as much so as anybody else. Do you think I like Stoffel\\nas well as I do you? No, no, no! Not a bit of it! I like you lots\\nbetter. Don't you want a pipe to smoke? You are man enough for that. Of\\ncourse you are; and why shouldn't you smoke a pipe like other men?\\\"\\n\\nMen, men!\\n\\nWalter answered that he couldn't smoke yet. It cost him an effort to\\nmake the admission; but his first attempt to equal Stoffel in that\\nrespect had turned out badly.\\n\\n\\\"So? You don't smoke?\\\" She omitted his \\\"yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, it's a good thing. It's a stupid habit in men. And forever the\\nterrible smoke! I know other young gentlemen who do not smoke. For\\ninstance, there is Piet Hammel. He's as old as you, but a little\\nsmaller. He's going to marry a cousin of mine; and he doesn't smoke\\neither.\\\"\\n\\nWalter felt better now. He was interested.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, they're going to get married about--well, I don't know exactly\\nwhen. But they intend to marry. I tell you, you are a real bachelor;\\nand it's awfully stupid of them still to treat you like a child. I've\\ntold your mother so a hundred times. There on the street just now,\\nwhen we were together--I'm a delicate woman; but do you think I\\nwas afraid?--with you with me? Not a bit. Not a trace of fear. And\\nwhy? Because everybody could see that I had a man with me. I ought\\nto have taken hold of your arm--you're almost taller than I am--but\\nI didn't do it because you had a package. And then--the people talk\\nso much! The watchman might have seen it, and he would have spread\\nthe news broadcast that I had been seen at night with a gentleman.\\\"\\n\\nWith a gentleman! Walter was listening.\\n\\n\\\"A woman must always think of her reputation. But we're here at home\\nnow, and that's very different, entirely different. I know that of\\ncourse you wouldn't tell anything bad about me. Whoever tells anything\\nbad on a woman isn't a true gentleman. You know that.\\\"\\n\\nYes, Walter knew it. He understood Juffrouw Laps better than she\\nimagined.\\n\\n\\\"What I wanted to say was, you must never go through that street. So\\nlong as you were a child, it made no difference. But now! Let me fill\\nyour glass for you.\\\"\\n\\nWalter drank.\\n\\nO Fancy, my muse, where art thou?\\n\\n\\\"How do you like it?\\\"\\n\\nWalter owned that the liquor had a pleasant taste.\\n\\nSatan's handmaid filled the glasses again. They were \\\"so small,\\\"\\nreally \\\"mere thimbles.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you must eat something, dearest. Oh, I have always thought so\\nmuch of you! It's good for you to have a little dram like that.\\\"\\n\\nWalter began to eat.\\n\\n\\\"Just take off your coat; there's nobody here but us.\\\"\\n\\nQuite so. Walter did take off his coat.\\n\\n\\\"And I'm going to sit close to you, for you are a dear, good,\\nsweet boy.\\\"\\n\\nFancy, Fancy!\\n\\nThe liquor was strong, and Walter drank more of it than was good\\nfor him. He lost some of his modesty, and hardly knew what he was\\nsaying to the talkative Juffrouw, as she asked questions from time\\nto time. She was not quite satisfied with the way things were going,\\nbut hoped for the best.\\n\\nOccasionally Walter found time to wonder why he was there, what the\\npurpose of the enforced visit might be. His hostess seemed to have\\nforgotten all about those thieves and murderers; and when he reminded\\nher of them, she showed a spirit of valor that did him good. For he\\nand his valor were undone.\\n\\n\\\"I will do them! Do you think I'm afraid of such a fellow? Well,\\nI guess not. Not afraid of three of them. I wouldn't be afraid of\\nten of them--I'm not afraid of the whole world. I will do them.\\\"\\n\\nAll the better, thought Walter; for then he wouldn't have to \\\"do\\\" them.\\n\\nThey now heard something rustling around in the closet, or else they\\nimagined they heard something. Walter was frightened. He was a perfect\\nchild again.\\n\\n\\\"Stay here, and I will see what it is,\\\" cried the Juffrouw. \\\"Do\\nyou think I would let them beat you, or stab you, or murder you,\\nmy boy! Never! Whoever touches you will have to walk over me. But I\\nwill give them all they need.\\\"\\n\\nShe went out, taking the light with her, to see what was the matter--if\\nanything. She was careful to leave Walter in the dark long enough for\\nhim to wish for her return. The tables were being turned. A little\\nmore, and the boy would seek protection under her apron.\\n\\n\\\"But, Juffrouw----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will let you call me Christine. That's my name.\\\"\\n\\nThis was too much for Walter. He preferred to avoid addressing her\\ndirectly.\\n\\n\\\"But hadn't I better go home now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not at all. You don't want to leave me, do you? You know your mother\\nis in bed asleep now. Besides, it was understood that you were to\\nspend the night here and take breakfast with me.\\\"\\n\\nBreakfast! The boy hadn't been doing anything else for an hour. Was\\nthat to continue till morning?\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you what! Just undress yourself; and you needn't be a bit\\nashamed before me. I will make down a pallet for you there in the\\ncorner. When I'm here alone--just a woman--with all the thieves and\\nrobbers--oh, it's so horrible!\\\"\\n\\nWalter did not dare to say no; nor did he dare to do what was proposed\\nso enticingly. He hesitated.\\n\\nShe talked sweetly and persuaded him.\\n\\nHe began to----\\n\\nThe child was as if hypnotized.\\n\\nO Fancy, Fancy! Where art thou?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\n\\n\\nIt will be remembered that on this significant Friday a boat-race\\nhad been arranged for the amusement of the visiting princes and\\nprincesses. It had to be called off on account of a disinclination\\non the side of the wind to fill its part of the program, or rather,\\nto fill the sails. For it was to have been a \\\"sail.\\\" Rowing was not\\nin style then; it was not considered dignified and manly. Besides,\\nthe boats were not built to be propelled in this way.\\n\\nThe boat-race had been canceled; but the crowd remained, and continued\\nto discharge its enthusiasm for royalty till a late hour. It was a\\ngreat day; and the populace perspired and shouted and howled.\\n\\nIt was so hot that kings and princesses perspired like ordinary\\nmortals. They flourished fans indolently. At that time there was a\\nspecial kind of fan: \\\"joujoux de Normandie.\\\"\\n\\nIt was observed that the old countess-palatine manipulated her fan more\\nelegantly than anyone else. No doubt it was through this \\\"gentle art\\\"\\nthat she exerted her greatest influence on humanity.\\n\\nGradually the carriages of the distinguished guests disappeared,\\nand the knightly horsemen tired of the saddle. The day drew to a\\nclose. The populace pushed and crowded and sang and hurrahed and\\ndrank. Fireworks were discharged, to express, so the newspapers said,\\nthe inexpressible love of the people for princes and princesses.\\n\\nOh, those firecrackers, and the danger in them! Quick, quick--throw\\nit--a second longer and it will burst in your hand--hurrah!\\n\\nIt was magnificent--the danger and thrilling anxiety. There was\\na tradition that somebody had once held a firecracker in his hand\\ntoo long and had been badly hurt by it. This traditional \\\"somebody\\\"\\nwas now inspiring the revelers with fresh enthusiasm.\\n\\nSo it was on that evening, before the city authorities had prohibited\\nthe use of fireworks. After the houses had been covered with slate,\\nit was thought that there was too much danger of fire in firecrackers,\\nbut on that evening, when the houses still had thatch roofs, the\\ndangerous pleasure of Amsterdam youth was unrestrained.\\n\\nAnd the other dangerous pleasures! How many lasses went home with their\\nskirts singed, some of them hardly getting home at all. Interesting\\nadventures! And a boy--\\\"those boys have to have their noses in\\neverything\\\"--yes, a youth came very near getting a load in his\\nface. Thrilling delight!\\n\\nThe crowd was now in the street where Juffrouw Laps resided. The\\nreader will recall that Walter was spending the night with her.\\n\\nBoom! went a gun, or a cannon-cracker; and Walter awoke just as his\\naffectionate hostess and religious adviser was going to give him\\na kiss.\\n\\nJuffrouw Laps had burned her sinful lips. \\\"Lord have mercy on us,\\nwhat is that!\\\" she cried.\\n\\nBoth ran to the open window. Ordinarily a respectable Hollandish girl\\nnever leaves her window open at night; but the extreme heat of the\\nevening must be urged in Juffrouw Laps's favor.\\n\\nIt was clear to them at once that they had not been fired upon by\\nthose \\\"murderers,\\\" for nobody paid any attention to them or showed any\\ninterest in them. Other windows were open, as well; and on all sides\\npeople were looking out. Right and left a cannonade of firecrackers\\nwas going on.\\n\\nIn the interest of privacy Juffrouw Laps took the precaution to blow\\nout the light as quickly as possible. Another might have neglected\\nthis.\\n\\nWalter looked down on it all with the delight of a child. He forgot\\nthe insistent kindness of his hostess; he thought of nothing but\\nthe crowd below and their antics. The noise and tumult sobered him;\\nand it even had a quieting effect on Juffrouw Laps.\\n\\n\\\"How foolish the people are. They push one another hither and thither\\nand don't know themselves why they do it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Click, click!\\\" answered an enthusiast with a gun. He was in the\\nmidst of a bevy of girls, who scattered in an uproar.\\n\\n\\\"They're all drunk,\\\" said Juffrouw Laps. \\\"I wish they would go\\nhome. I'm tired--and it's two o'clock.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just a little more!\\\" begged Walter. \\\"I'm not tired--not a bit!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid you're catching cold. For you know, the night air after\\na hot day--well, put on your cap, dearest. I wouldn't have this night\\nair to give you a cold for everything in the world. Look, there goes\\nanother one.\\\" It was a Roman candle.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Amour \\u00e0 la plus belle.\\n    Honneur au plus vaillant----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Why don't they sing Dutch? Do you understand any of it?\\\"\\n\\nWalter knew something of the handsome Dunois, who slew so many Turks\\nand received as his reward the daughter of the duke, his master. How\\nwould a knight be rewarded after he had already received one reward? Or\\nhow would it have been if the master had had no daughter?\\n\\nWhile Walter was asking his lady friend such difficult questions as\\nthese, they heard an outburst of cries and abuse and oaths below. A\\nreaction had set in. It was a perfect riot. The crowd swayed first\\none way then the other, according as one party or the other was in\\nthe ascendency.\\n\\nNon-combatants were pushing their way out; combatants, themselves\\ncrowded, were crowding others. Cries of \\\"help\\\" were heard. Mothers,\\nwith babies in their arms, attested their fear; women in delicate\\nhealth made their condition known.\\n\\nThe press was worst on the corner, whither the revelers were streaming\\nfrom three directions. Here was located a popular restaurant and\\ndrinking-place, which was probably the destination of the stream coming\\nfrom Amstel Street. The second stream, coming from Utrecht Street,\\nevidently had the same objective in view. The strongest current\\nwas flowing from the belligerent group, which was now squeezed into\\nclose quarters.\\n\\nFrom his recent experience Walter knew what it meant to be in such a\\nmob. Whoever fell was walked over. But it really wasn't so bad as that:\\nto fall was impossible. The danger was in being crowded off the street\\ninto basements, where limbs and necks might be easily broken. In this\\nrespect there was more danger than there had been the evening before\\nin Kalver Street.\\n\\n\\\"Christian souls!\\\" cried Juffrouw Laps. \\\"I'm getting right sick at\\nthe stomach.\\\"\\n\\nWalter's condition was about the same. All at once he seized her\\narm. He thought that he saw somebody--somebody who looked like----\\n\\n\\\"That's right, dear. Hold fast to me. It's simply death and murder!\\\"\\n\\nWalter did not say anything.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't it enough to run anybody crazy?\\\" continued the dear\\nJuffrouw. \\\"Hold fast to me, and remember that I am your Christine.\\\"\\n\\nHe was remembering something else.\\n\\n\\\"Don't be afraid--Lord, that child's beside himself--nobody shall\\nhurt you. I will take care of you.\\\"\\n\\nHe held on to her arm all the tighter; otherwise he was as if turned\\nto stone.\\n\\n\\\"I wouldn't pay any attention to it, sweetheart. But--it is bad\\nenough. Do you see that girl there with the North Holland cap on? I\\nwouldn't like to be in her place.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is--Femke! O God, it is Femke!\\\"\\n\\nShaking off Juffrouw Laps, who attempted to hold him back, he rushed\\ndown the steps and in a few minutes was in the thickest of the fray.\\n\\nHe fought his way through the crowd like a mad-man, soon reaching the\\npoint where he had seen Femke. She, however, had disappeared. A man\\nwith flashy cap and sailor's jacket, who from above had looked like\\nher escort, was still contending with the crowd. It seemed as if the\\ntwo had come arm in arm through Amstel Street.\\n\\n\\\"Is there a girl here with a North Holland cap on?\\\"\\n\\nThe man was too busy fighting and wrestling for standing-room to make\\nanswer. Meanwhile, Walter noticed that the fellow was struggling\\ntoward the \\\"Herberge,\\\" and concluded that his lady must have taken\\nrefuge there.\\n\\nWalter paid no more attention to the punches and blows he received. He\\nwas only concerned to give as many blows as were necessary to hasten\\nhis arrival at the restaurant. The place was about as badly crowded\\nas the street, but there was no fighting going on.\\n\\nYes, Walter had made a good beginning: yesterday in the \\\"Polish\\nCoffeehouse,\\\" to-day in the \\\"Juniper Berry\\\"--thrown in there, fighting\\nhis way in here.\\n\\nHe was in the restaurant at last, looking for Femke. Now he thought\\nthat he had discovered her, standing on a step, or something of the\\nkind. With lips tightly closed, her arms crossed, the girl was looking\\nquietly down on the multitude as if in silent contempt. The rim was\\ntorn from her cap and was hanging down. Walter thought that he even\\nsaw blood on her face--Femke's dear face!\\n\\nHe was exhausted and could not reach her. He looked at her. She did\\nnot see him.\\n\\nShe stood there proud and haughty. He called to her. She did not hear.\\n\\n\\\"O God! she despises me. I deserve it for my cowardice at Holsma's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Boy,\\\" said the woman behind the bar, \\\"we don't have any bellowing\\nhere. If you want to bellow go to your mother.\\\"\\n\\nEasier said than done. He couldn't move a peg, such was the press. He\\nwas shoved against the counter; and it was impossible for him to keep\\nsight of Femke. The tears began to roll down his cheeks.\\n\\n\\\"What are you doing in such a crowd anyway?\\\" continued the woman,\\n\\\"when you're so weak. You look as flimsy as a dish-rag. What have\\nyou been doing? Let me give you a glass of cognac.\\\"\\n\\nHe would have been only too glad to pay for his place; but, as he\\n\\\"received at home everything that he needed,\\\" he did not have\\nthe wherewithal. Still, there was no danger of his being thrown\\nout. The crowd, which was threatening to expend its remaining\\nenergy in destroying the liquids of the place, was now occupying the\\nbarmaid's attention. I should say Mrs. Goremest's attention. She was\\nthe proprietress.\\n\\nThe girl continued to hold her position of advantage. There was\\nsomething scornful in her features. \\\"Who dares!\\\" she seemed to say.\\n\\nWalter was feeling bad. She looked over in his direction, but without\\nseeing him. He called; but she did not hear.\\n\\nThen the fellow with the flashy cap and sailor jacket appeared in the\\ndoor. He had not been one of the belligerents; but he had suffered\\nthe fate of neutral powers. As his clothing testified, both parties\\nhad been his enemies.\\n\\nSo intent was the fellow on getting in that he did not even take time\\nto return the shoves and cuffs that he received. Twice, three times\\nhe was crowded back; for where so many want the same thing, it isn't\\neasy to obtain. Nevertheless, he had one advantage over the others,\\nwho sought only a resting-place and a glass of liquor. He was incited\\nby something else.\\n\\nWalter hoped with all his heart that the fellow would succeed in\\nreaching Femke. She looked so lonely in the midst of that wild mob. If\\nhe had been stronger, he would have--but she wouldn't have anything to\\ndo with him. Wouldn't she push him off, just as she did the insolent\\nfellow who first caught hold of her apron?\\n\\nThe girl seemed now to spy the sailor. She nodded to him and smiled,\\nas if to encourage him. Or was she thanking him for his fidelity? Her\\nsmile bore the message that she was uninjured, and fearless. Yes,\\nshe stood there a statute of repose.\\n\\nThe sailor nodded back.\\n\\nHe would never have denied her, Walter thought.\\n\\nMrs. Goremest happened to see the new arrival; and, from the way she\\ngreeted him, he seemed to be a frequent visitor to her place:\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Klaas. Are you there too? You're out of breath, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\nShe gave orders to let him through, and even came out a few steps\\nand helped open up the way for him.\\n\\nThus it happened that Klaas Verlaan found standing-room at the counter\\nnot far from Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Well, they've made the most of you!\\\"\\n\\nHe saw it the same way. He was never certain of a moment's recreation\\nbefore bedtime. Walter, as well as the girl who still maintained her\\nelevated position in the corner, agreed with the bar-woman's verdict.\\n\\n\\\"Had a good day?\\\" continued the woman. \\\"It was bad about the\\nboat-race.\\\"\\n\\nKlaas placed his finger on his mouth, as if he were going to tell\\nher a secret. He wanted to tell of an adventure with Princess Erika.\\n\\n\\\"A glass of corn?\\\" translated the bar-woman, but without guessing\\nthe right thing.\\n\\n\\\"Half and half?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nor that either.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Red?\\\"\\n\\nThis time Klaas was particularly dainty and hard to please. He declined\\nregularly whatever she suggested and continued to exert himself to\\ndraw her into a more confidential talk. He had had the pleasure of\\npulling Princess Erika out of the water.\\n\\nOn the outside they were still singing, \\\"Amour \\u00e0 la plus belle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The devil take those Welsh songs!\\\" cried one of the drinkers. \\\"We\\nare Dutchmen forever!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we are Dutchman forever----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And our prince----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sh!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will sing what I please; and, if anybody doesn't want to sing\\\"--he\\nstruck himself on the chest, and the whole party was Dutch and\\nenthusiastic over royalty. \\\"Our Prince\\\" was sung lustily, and to\\na finish.\\n\\n\\\"Hurrah!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, when we were still true Dutchmen----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, when we were still true Dutchmen----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And under the republic!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Long live the republic!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You all ought to have seen a yacht-race then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And our prince----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Under the republic all men were equal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Equal. No difference at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Down with the tyrants!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They're not a bit better than we are!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They suck the life out of the people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, they bleed us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And why? Because you're all cowardly dogs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, they're all cowardly dogs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You put your necks under the yoke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whenever a king comes around, or an emperor, or a prince, then all\\nof you are so frightened you tremble like an aspen leaf.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, like an aspen leaf!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you fellows were----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All men are born free.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we were born free and equal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And true Dutch hearts--what say you, Mrs. Goremest? What do you think,\\nthat's a daughter of M'neer----\\\"\\n\\nThe name died on the speaker's lips. He became pale.\\n\\n\\\"A daughter of M'neer----!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly. Ask Verlaan.\\\"\\n\\nVerlaan nodded.\\n\\n\\\"Is that so, Klaas? Really and truly? Why then does she stand there\\ndressed that way--like an ordinary girl?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, those clothes came from my Gertie, you know. Rich people have----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, boys, we must go home now. Mother Goremest needs sleep,\\ntoo. We are not made of iron; we are flesh and blood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Down with the tyrants! We were born free. True Dutch hearts----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sh! The young lady----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What? That girl? What then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sh! The daughter of--but don't say a word. Damme if it isn't so--the\\ndaughter of M'neer--Kopperlith!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Kopperlith on Keizersgracht? What are you talking about,\\nman! Kopperlith--on Keizersgracht!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, of course. Come, we're going.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His daughter? His----natural daughter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's right. You understand it now; but keep quiet about it.\\\"\\n\\nThe true Dutch hearts and republicans paid and left the bar.\\n\\nIt was a sudden whim of Klaas Verlaan's to make his ward a child of\\nKeizersgracht; but it brought him in more ducats than he cared to\\nadmit afterward.\\n\\nKopperlith? Kopperlith? on Keizersgracht? Femke on Keizersgracht! And\\non the day after to-morrow he was to begin work for this wealthy\\ngentleman.\\n\\nHis head swam. Was he still Walter Pieterse? He doubted it. Before\\nhe had quite come to himself, he was forced through the door with\\nother late stragglers. It was time for Mrs. Goremest to close.\\n\\nThe street was comparatively quiet now. Walter remained near the\\n\\\"Herberge,\\\" which to him was a sort of temple where his Goddess was\\nbeing worshiped. Now and then somebody else was pitched out the door,\\nwho would have been glad to stay longer. It was not every day that\\none got an opportunity to see a daughter of M'neer Kopperlith. Some\\nwanted to join the triumvirate of Verlaan, the republican speaker,\\nand Mrs. Goremest; but the three felt themselves strong enough to do\\nthe work and share the rewards.\\n\\nAt last the outflow ceased, and Walter was just going to peep through\\nthe curtains of the glass door, when the door opened again and the\\nrepublican emerged. Walter heard Klaas call to him:\\n\\n\\\"There on the corner in Paarden Street, you know. If it costs a dollar\\nmore, that's all right. Tell the cabby----\\\"\\n\\nWalter understood. The republican was to get a cab--for Femke?\\n\\nWalter waited. In the meanwhile, Mrs. Goremest had locked the door and\\ndrawn the curtains, so that it was impossible for him to look in now.\\n\\nIn a short time a carriage drove up, and the republican sprang out\\nof it. The door of Mrs. Goremest's establishment opened again, and\\nKlaas Verlaan with the ostensible daughter of Kopperlith appeared.\\n\\n\\\"Femke, I am here!\\\" Walter cried, hurrying to her. \\\"I am here. Oh,\\nFemke, don't go with the strange men!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What in the devil are you doing here again!\\\" snorted Verlaan, seizing\\nWalter by the collar to pull him back into the restaurant. \\\"What do\\nyou want? And who are you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Femke, don't go with the strange men. I will take you home, I,\\nWalter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The boy is weak in the upper story,\\\" affirmed Mrs. Goremest. \\\"He's\\nbeen bellowing around her the whole evening like a calf, and he hasn't\\nspent a doit.\\\"\\n\\nWalter reached for Femke's hand; and then he noticed how curiously\\nshe was rigged out. She was completely covered. Of her head,\\nface, shoulders, figure--nothing was to be seen. Mrs. Goremest\\nhad contributed her cloak; but what would one not do for a\\nKopperlith? Still, she was saving: Only the stump of one tallow\\ncandle was burning. It flickered strangely, giving to everything a\\nghostly appearance.\\n\\n\\\"Is it you, Erich?\\\" the girl asked.\\n\\n\\\"Femke, Femke, for God's sake, don't go with those strange men!\\\"\\n\\nTearing himself away from Verlaan, he threw himself at Femke's feet. He\\npulled aside her cloak and covered her hand with tears and kisses.\\n\\n\\\"Just like I tell you,\\\" declared Mrs. Goremest. \\\"The boy is as crazy\\nas a bedbug.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Femke, I will never deny you again. Strike me, tread on me, kill me,\\nbut--don't go with those strange men.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Light!\\\" cried the girl peremptorily--a word that even a Dutchman\\nunderstands.\\n\\nThe republican took the candle from the counter and held it so that\\nthe light fell on Walter's face. The boy was still kneeling. Through\\nan opening in her hood the girl looked down on him and was silent. She\\ndid not withdraw the hand that Walter held closely pressed to his lips.\\n\\nVerlaan made a motion as if to remove the intruder; but the girl\\nstopped him with a look. Then she laid her free hand on Walter's head,\\nsaying simply:\\n\\n\\\"My brother!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Another descendant of Kopperlith!\\\" growled the republican. The young\\npeople have strange ideas about how to spend the night.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Walter came to his senses, he was in the street again. The\\ncarriage had driven away--whether with her, or without her; whether\\nwith the two men, or without them--that he did not know. It made\\nno difference to him: she had called him \\\"brother,\\\" seriously,\\nsolemnly. She had spoken clearly and distinctly.\\n\\n\\\"O God! I thank thee. Thou art kind and compassionate. I didn't\\nknow that Femke could speak like that. She must have felt it down in\\nher heart.\\\"\\n\\nTo-morrow, he thought, he would become immensely wealthy--in\\n\\\"business\\\"--and, of course, he was going to be a king again, and\\nstill more: For Femke he would be more than a brother! Juffrouw Laps\\nhad awakened in him--well, something, he did not know himself what it\\nwas. His heart rejoiced; he walked upon stilts, as tired as he was,\\nand wondered that his head did not bump against the clouds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\n\\n\\nFor anyone in Walter's present mood, there are only two things in\\nthe world; self, and--nothingness!\\n\\nWalter looked about him. \\\"Butter Market,\\\" he read on a sign. He noticed\\nthat in the street socks could be bought, wagons hired, etc., etc.\\n\\nBut what did it all mean? Nothing. He had kissed Femke's hand!\\n\\nIt is too bad that the world did not sink out of existence on that\\nsummer night.\\n\\nIf Walter had noticed such an occurrence, he might have asked if\\nFemke was hurt; otherwise the phenomenon would not have disturbed him.\\n\\nThe reader will understand, of course, that on this eventful night\\nthe world did not go down.\\n\\nWalter forgave the sun for rising. He even excused the Butter Market\\nfor being such a hot place; but it was difficult for him to convince\\nhimself that it was not all a dream.\\n\\nA new feeling took possession of him. His ambitious plans of a material\\nnature receded into the background of consciousness. His one desire\\nnow was to love Femke--and win her love. Those continents that were\\nexpecting salvation from him might wait.\\n\\nHe thought of Femke and her soft hand. Never had her hand felt like\\nthat. Formerly it had seemed harder and rougher; but, of course,\\nhe had just been mistaken about it. He imagined, too, that hitherto\\nhe had not marked her voice well, nor her carriage. Surely, he had\\nnever seen the true Femke till to-night--better, this morning.\\n\\nBut--Klaas Verlaan and his rough companions! What did all that\\ngab about M'neer Kopperlith mean? There were other questions too;\\nbut--Femke had called him brother; and that was one thing which with\\nhim was as firm as the rock of Gibraltar.\\n\\nBrooding thus, he slipped along through the streets. Weak and tired,\\nhe came to the \\\"Dam.\\\" Here he saw a long row of carriages. The\\ncoachmen sat in their places waiting for the princely guests, who\\nhad wanted to see a Holland sunrise. The sun was already in sight;\\nbut there were no princes and princesses to see him. A few laborers\\nwere looking on indifferently.\\n\\nYesterday Walter would have exerted himself to see a live, fullgrown\\nking, just to find out if he looked like Macbeth, or Arthur, or\\nLear. To-day he was so tired that kings did not interest him.\\n\\nHe was just starting on, when the coachmen suddenly assumed a rigid\\nattitude. A boy remarked that \\\"they\\\" were coming now. He was right:\\nthey did come; and all, except one old lady, drove away so rapidly that\\nscarcely anyone saw them. She touched her coachman on the shoulder.\\n\\n\\\"She has forgotten something,\\\" said the boy.\\n\\nThree or four cavaliers stormed back into the palace and brought her\\nfan. While they were gone, the boys wondered at the pimples on her\\nface. Walter's  pictures had had nothing of that kind. How different\\nFemke's face was!\\n\\nWalter trudged along further; and, without thinking of where he was\\ngoing, he came to the meadow where Femke and her mother dried their\\nclothes. He sat down on the grass, intending to wait for the first\\nsigns of life in Femke's home. He was not certain that she was there;\\nhe did not know but that she might still be at Holsma's; but there\\nwould be somebody there.\\n\\nOvercome by weariness he lay down and gradually fell asleep. His cap\\ncame off, rolled down into the ditch and disappeared in the mud.\\n\\nIf anyone passed by, he remarked that there lay a drunken fellow. Yes,\\nyouth begins early. Possibly the fellow was sick; but then the police\\nwould take care of him. Nobody hurt him; nobody touched him. His\\ndreams were undisturbed.\\n\\nHe dreamed of various things; but the principal object of his dreams\\nwas a young girl, who was standing on a platform playing ball with\\nheavy men, as if that were nothing. Suddenly it was little Sietske\\nHolsma.\\n\\nThen in his dreams he heard a voice:\\n\\n\\\"Goodness, boy, how did you get here?\\\"\\n\\nAt first the voice was far away, then nearer, and finally quite\\nnear. He had the dim impression that somebody was pulling him up to\\na sitting posture.\\n\\n\\\"Sietske!\\\" he whispered, still sleeping.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's my name. How did you know it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sietske----!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, certainly. Who told you? And what are you doing here. It isn't\\nvery respectable. Are you drunk? And so young, too.\\\"\\n\\nHe called Sietske's name again.\\n\\n\\\"You may call me by my first name, if you want to; but how does it\\ncome? Did Femke tell you? It's a real disgrace to lie here like a\\nhog. What were you going to say?\\\"\\n\\nWalter rubbed his eyes and felt of his head. \\\"I would like to wash\\nmyself,\\\" he said, not yet wide awake.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" cried Mrs. Claus. \\\"And you're not hurt, are you? Where\\nis your cap?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wash--with cold water,\\\" Walter said.\\n\\n\\\"Good! Come to the pump with me.\\\" She led him through the house and\\nacross the back yard.\\n\\n\\\"You needn't be afraid to undress here; nobody can see you. But how\\ndid you happen to call me by my first name all at once. Not that I'm\\noffended at all.\\\"\\n\\nWalter was still too much asleep to recall what had happened to him\\nduring the past few hours; so he only said that he had a headache\\nand must wash himself first.\\n\\nMrs. Claus, noticing that he was ashamed to undress, hung some quilts\\non the fence, thus converting the yard into a sort of room. It never\\noccurred to her that her own presence might embarrass him. Walter\\nwas still not quite pleased with the outlook for a bath; but since\\nyesterday he had been thinking of other things as strange.\\n\\nHe began to strip, allowing Mrs. Claus to help him, just as if he\\nhad been fifteen years younger than he was. To Mrs. Claus he was only\\na child.\\n\\nShe laid him on a bench under the spout and began to pump. At the first\\ndrops he shivered; then the water flooded his head and shoulders. He\\ncould neither see nor speak. His efforts to speak she interpreted as\\ncalls for more water.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, this will be good for you.\\\" Her words were drowned by the\\nsplashing water.\\n\\n\\\"You didn't hurt yourself, did you? Do you think that will be enough\\nnow? I've pumped till I've got a pain in my side. But if you think\\nthat----\\\"\\n\\nShe stopped all at once, but still held on to the pump handle, as if\\nto show her willingness to continue.\\n\\n\\\"I forgot entirely to\\\"--she began pumping again--\\\"wash you off with\\ngreen soap. Femke always washes herself with it. It makes the skin\\nnice and smooth.--You ought to see your back now. It shines like\\na looking-glass.\\\"\\n\\nWalter wanted to say something but couldn't.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and your forehead, too. It's the green soap that does it. I\\nguess your mother never washes you with green soap, does she? Then\\none must scour and scrub and rub. But, if you are not used to soap----\\\"\\n\\nShe lifted that terrible pump handle again.\\n\\n\\\"I believe this will be about enough,\\\" Walter blubbered. His mouth\\nwas so full of water that again Mrs. Claus did not understand him.\\n\\n\\\"Green soap is good for corns, and for rheumatism.\\\" She was pumping\\naway for dear life.\\n\\nWalter finally succeeded in rescuing himself and the bench from\\nthat destructive stream of water. He was now able to make his cries\\nfor mercy understood; but he was not yet able to get up. Besides,\\nthe good woman had hung his clothes out of his reach, and he was\\nashamed. He remained sitting.\\n\\n\\\"Do you want anything else?\\\" inquired the water nymph.\\n\\n\\\"No, no, no!\\\" he answered quickly. She was already lifting the\\npump-handle again. \\\"But----\\\"\\n\\nThe simple, innocent woman did not understand; and, when he continued\\nto sit there like a helpless lump of misery, she asked:\\n\\n\\\"Do you have a pain anywhere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I haven't any pains.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you tired?\\\"\\n\\nHe was still tired, and said so.\\n\\n\\\"And I woke you up! I'll tell you what, you must go to sleep and take\\na good nap.\\\"\\n\\nShe began drying him off, as if that were a usual thing in her day's\\nwork. Then she rolled him up in a sheet and carried him off like a sack\\nof clothes. He could not but notice the way she laid him down. Then\\nshe covered him warmly.\\n\\n\\\"Straighten out your legs, my boy.\\\"\\n\\nWalter did as she said, and experienced an indescribable feeling of\\ncomfort. And when she punched him and patted him and tucked him in,\\nand said: \\\"Poor child, you can sleep good now. This is Femke's bed,\\nyou know----\\\" then he was more than comfortable; he was delighted.\\n\\nWhen he awakened at about four o'clock in the afternoon he heard\\nwhispering voices. He listened, at first to find out where he was,\\nand then to understand what was being said.\\n\\nIt seemed as if there were a plot further to confuse Sietske with\\nFemke in his mind.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Sietske; but what does he mean by lying out like that? If I\\nwere his mother----\\\"\\n\\nThe answer was:\\n\\n\\\"Cousin, I don't suppose his mother knows about it. Hermann did the\\nsame thing once. That's the way boys are.\\\"\\n\\nOho! Sietske was there; and Mrs. Claus was her cousin, and her name\\nwas Sietske too! And that girl--there in Mrs. Goremest's place?\\n\\nHis thoughts became more and more confused; though physically he\\nfelt well.\\n\\nHow would it do, he thought, to tear a little piece out of the sheet,\\nso as to be able to examine it to-morrow and make certain of himself\\nand his adventures?\\n\\nIf he had been accustomed to fine bedlinen at home, he might now\\nhave taken an especial pleasure in Mrs. Claus's extremely rough\\nhomemade linen. Hm! He had always dreamed of princesses sleeping on\\nembroidered silk, among diamonds and pearls! He did not yet know that\\nit is possible to conceive royal and imperial highnesses otherwise\\nat night, and that perhaps a princess might sometimes be willing to\\ntousle Femke's bed.\\n\\nHe looked about the room. There was another small bed, where, he\\nsupposed, Femke's mother slept. Across the room was the chimney. Here\\nwere small shelves decorated with works of art. Walter noticed the\\n\\\"resurrection of Lazarus.\\\" Four chairs were in the room. One was\\nstanding by his bed, and on it his clothes were carefully arranged.\\n\\nIn the middle of the room stood a table; and the drawer was partly\\nopen. It was too full. Father Jansen's woolen socks were peeping\\nout while they waited for repairs. Walter wondered if those other\\nobjectionable articles were there too.\\n\\nOn the wall, at the head of his bed, hung a crucifix, with a small\\nbasin of holy water. With that she crosses herself, he thought. He\\nstuck his hand into it: it was dry. The whole arrangement was fastened\\nto an embroidered piece of cardboard, and, when he touched it,\\nsomething fell from behind it.\\n\\nIt looked like a large-sized letter. Walter picked it up and looked for\\nthe address. He felt that it must be a letter from Femke to him. Then\\nhe reproached himself, and, trembling with emotion, restored the piece\\nof paper to its place. He had held it up to the light: it was the\\nOphelia that he had presented her after his illness! She had treasured\\nthe picture together with the most sacred thing she possessed.\\n\\nHe was wide awake now; but who wouldn't wake up on receiving a letter\\nfrom Heaven?\\n\\nHe dressed himself and went into the other room, where he supposed\\nMrs. Claus and Sietske were. Not a soul was to be seen. For the first\\ntime it occurred to him that after those few words he had heard nothing\\nmore. The girl had surely visited her \\\"cousin\\\" and then gone away.\\n\\nBut Mrs. Claus herself? Perhaps she, too, had gone away. This was\\nthe case; however, she had not gone out without leaving behind her\\na peculiar sign of her uncouth character and lack of refinement. On\\na small table, before which stood an inviting chair, lay two pieces\\nof bread and butter of her standard make. Beside them was a pot of\\ncoffee. To be sure, it was cold now; but--well, Walter acted quickly\\n\\\"according to his convictions.\\\"\\n\\nOther thoughts now forced themselves on his mind. The \\\"House of\\nPieterse\\\" appeared to his mind's eye as a menacing waterspout. In\\nthe face of this danger difficult questions that had been clamoring\\nfor answer had to be forgotten.\\n\\nTo go home? For heaven's sake, no!\\n\\nHis mother, Stoffel, his sisters--all had turned into Macbethan\\nwitches. In his imagination, even Leentje had deserted him and was\\nasking him to beg forgiveness for his shameful behavior. He thought\\nof the prodigal son; though he knew that no calf, fat or otherwise,\\nwould be slaughtered on his return.\\n\\nSakkerloot! I haven't done anything wrong; I haven't squandered\\nanything--not a doit of my inheritance! Have I allowed the wine to\\nrun out? Not a drop!\\n\\nBut something must have been the matter; for--he did not dare to\\ngo home.\\n\\nHave I had any pleasure? Have I enjoyed any feast with four young\\nladies? No! Have I allowed hounds to run around loose in the\\nbanquet-hall? Have I had any negro servant to hold my horse?\\n\\nThere he took his stand. And he stayed there. Of camels and girls and\\nwine he felt that he was innocent; but himself, and his adventures\\nof the night, he was unable further to explain.\\n\\n\\\"I wish I were a crumb of bread,\\\" he sighed, as he stuck one into\\nhis mouth, \\\"then I would know where I belong.\\\"\\n\\nDoubtless the first crumb of bread that was ever envied by a ruler.\\n\\nGo to America?\\n\\nYes, if he only had those hundred florins that Mr. Motto had relieved\\nhim of. Of course that worthy gentleman was now living like a prince\\non the money. At least, Juffrouw Pieterse had said as much. But,\\neven if he had the money, he could not go away and leave Mrs. Claus's\\nhouse to the mercy of stray thieves and robbers. In a way, hadn't he\\non yesterday evening taken the field against robbers?\\n\\nBesides, he had no cap. There was nothing in sight that looked like\\na hat. Yes--there hung a North Holland cap!\\n\\nFemke? America?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX\\n\\n\\nWhile Walter was looking at Femke's cap and revolving other plans of\\nescape, the door opened and Kaatje, the girl from Holsma's, walked\\nin. Not recognizing her, Walter did not understand her when she said\\nthat Femke had sent her to ask how he was. He looked at the messenger\\nsearchingly; then he asked:\\n\\n\\\"Are you trying to make a fool of me?\\\"\\n\\nHe had puzzled over recent events till everything seemed ghostly and\\nunreal; and he was angry.\\n\\n\\\"My dear sir, Femke sent me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What Femke? Somebody's grandmother again.\\\" He took a step forward;\\nand his attitude was threatening.\\n\\n\\\"Are you that giant Miller's sweetheart?\\\" taking another step forward,\\nwhile Kaatje fell back.\\n\\n\\\"Young man!\\\"\\n\\nKaatje was already outside of the door, Walter close after her with\\nhis fists doubled up.\\n\\n\\\"Young man, what's the matter with you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter with me? I'm tired of being made a fool of. You\\nunderstand?\\\"\\n\\nShe retreated backwards; he pursued. It may have looked comical; but\\nthat was the way his anger chose to express itself. In this manner\\nthe girl returned by the same way she came, which was the footpath\\nacross the meadow where the clothes were dried.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, heavens! If the doctor would only come.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you think of me?\\\" Walter said, punctuating his words.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Lord!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you think I'm drunk?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no, no. Not at all!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or crazy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no!--Where can the doctor be so long!\\\"\\n\\nTwo very similar shouts put an end to the strained situation.\\n\\n\\\"Thank God, there he is!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank God, there it is!\\\"\\n\\nOne cry came from Dr. Holsma's coachman, who was driving up hurriedly;\\nthe other cry meant that two boys, who were fishing in the ditch for\\nfrogs, had caught Walter's cap.\\n\\nWalter accepted his lost property without question or complaint;\\nwhile Kaatje, with tears in her eyes, ran up to Dr. Holsma to explain\\nwhat was the matter.\\n\\n\\\"Is it really so bad?\\\" asked that gentleman presently.\\n\\nHe approached Walter, who was shaking the mud from his cap, glad to\\nthink that he was concealing his embarrassment and fright.\\n\\n\\\"Well, my boy, it's a good thing I met you here. I wanted to ask you\\nif you wouldn't like to take dinner with us this evening. Afterwards\\nwe will all go out for a little amusement, if you like.\\\"\\n\\nThat was the tone Walter needed to hear. He burst into tears.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, thank you! That will be nice for my mother, too.\\\"\\n\\nHolsma motioned to Kaatje, who had timidly retired to the background.\\n\\n\\\"Go to Juffrouw Pieterse and tell her that the young gentleman dines\\nwith us, and that he is going to spend the evening with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" cried Walter quickly, \\\"and----\\\"\\n\\nThe doctor looked at him anxiously. He was afraid that he saw symptoms\\nof the alleged mental disorder; but Walter's eye was calm and gave\\nno ground for fear.\\n\\n\\\"M'neer, can't she say too that I----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Out with it, my boy! What have you on your heart?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That I was with you--all day!\\\"\\n\\nHolsma reflected.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly,\\\" he said, \\\"all day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From early this morning--from seven o'clock on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From seven o'clock on,\\\" the doctor repeated.\\n\\n\\\"And--I ate breakfast at your house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, the young gentleman ate breakfast at our house. To be\\nsure, he ate breakfast with us. Kaatje, you can ride in the carriage\\nwith us.\\\"\\n\\nAs Holsma helped Walter in he gave the coachman directions to stop at\\nJuffrouw Pieterse's, where \\\"the girl\\\" was \\\"to leave a message.\\\" When\\nhe took a seat by his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9, Walter pressed his hand and exclaimed:\\n\\\"Oh, what a good fortune it is that I found you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you think so? It was only a--mere accident. Mrs. Claus is a----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A cousin?\\\" interrupted Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and she's a good woman,\\\" said Holsma. \\\"She is a cousin of ours,\\nand I came to visit her. I do that every week, not as a physician,\\nbut as a kinsman. You can go to see her as much as you like: nothing\\nwill hurt you there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"M'neer!\\\" exclaimed Walter suddenly--and he caught his breath--\\\"I\\nthink so much of Femke!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So?\\\" answered Holsma dryly. \\\"I do too.\\\"\\n\\nThe doctor was diagnosing Walter's case; but he preferred to do it\\nquietly. While speaking of indifferent things, he noted that Kaatje had\\nbeen mistaken; that Walter was both excited and exhausted, but that\\nhis mind was unaffected. On the contrary, his mind was growing. His\\nsoul was expanding.\\n\\nWhen Kaatje left the carriage, Walter felt that the time had come to\\ngive and receive explanations. Holsma was of a contrary opinion. He\\nwas friendly enough, but showed no inclination for heart-to-heart\\nconfidences. Walter's confusing story was promptly interrupted.\\n\\n\\\"I've heard that you're going to enter the world of business.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir, the day after to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, that isn't bad, if you get into the right hands. You must work,\\nthough; and that's good for boys like you.\\\"\\n\\nFearing that Walter might imagine he was something more than the\\naverage boy, Holsma continued immediately:\\n\\n\\\"It's a good thing for everybody, especially young people. They're\\nall alike; and all need to work. All boys must work; and girls,\\ntoo. Everybody must work.\\\"\\n\\nWalter did not understand that the doctor was giving him a dose\\nof medicine; but he saw that the time for explanations had not\\nyet arrived. Still he would have felt better if he could have\\nunburdened his mind of at least a part of those persistent memories\\nof last night. His instinct of chivalry would have prevented him\\nfrom mentioning the details of the Laps affair, which, after all,\\nhad only been an ineffective attack.\\n\\nHe began again; but the doctor interrupted him before he had hardly\\nmentioned the fried potatoes.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, such things happen to everybody. That doesn't amount to\\nanything. The thing for young people to do--and for old people,\\ntoo--is to work. It seems to be rather windy.\\\"\\n\\nThat was true. If it had only been as windy yesterday.\\n\\n\\\"Do you like pictures?\\\" asked Holsma, when they had left the carriage\\nand were entering his home.\\n\\n\\\"Of course!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good! Just go into that room. Look at everything as long as you\\nplease.\\\"\\n\\nThe doctor pushed him into the room, then ran through the hall and\\nup the stairs to prepare the family for Walter's reception.\\n\\nWalter found little pleasure in paintings. He had had no training\\nin art. For him, a man with a dog and a hare was merely a man with a\\ndog and a hare. He felt that a poem ought to have been written about\\nit all; then it would have been intelligible. His glance fell on the\\nportrait of a woman, or a queen, or a fairy, or a mayor's daughter.\\n\\nFemke!\\n\\nInstead of the North Holland cap she wore a diadem of sparkling stars,\\nor rays of----\\n\\n\\\"Dinner is ready, and papa and mamma invite you to come out to the\\ndining-room. Are you still sore after your fall?\\\" It was little\\nSietske.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't fall.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean from your fall on the table in the coffee-house. How\\ncomical! Well, if you are all right again, we're going out this\\nevening--papa, mamma, William, Hermann, you, I--all! We're going to\\nthe theatre!\\\"\\n\\nSietske had understood her orders.\\n\\n\\\"Going out?--to the theatre? But my mother----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Papa will attend to that. Don't worry; he will arrange everything.\\\"\\n\\nOnce out in the hall, Walter hesitated again. He motioned to Sietske\\nand took her back into the room.\\n\\n\\\"Sietske, who is that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is a great-great-great-great-grandmother of ours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But she looks like----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Like Femke! Of course. Like me, too. When Hermann puts on such a\\ncap you can't tell him from Femke. Come, now. We mustn't keep mamma\\nwaiting.\\\"\\n\\nOn entering the dining-room Walter was met by that quiet cordiality\\nthat the doctor had prescribed. When all were seated Sietske mentioned\\nthe picture again in apologizing to Walter for hurrying him away\\nfrom it.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" remarked the doctor quietly, \\\"there is some resemblance;\\nbut Femke is not so pretty. No, not by a great deal.\\\"\\n\\nA cold douche!\\n\\nWalter had never thought of Femke's beauty. He really did not know\\nwhether the girl was pretty, or not.\\n\\n\\\"Will you take some sauce, Walter?\\\"\\n\\nShe had called him brother, so solemnly, and with such a mien! Of\\ncourse the lady in the portrait, with the sparkling diadem, would\\nhold out her hand the same way. Walter made an awkward gesture with\\nhis hand.\\n\\n\\\"Salad?\\\" asked Sietske.\\n\\n\\\"It will be crowded,\\\" said Mevrouw Holsma. \\\"Everyone will want to see\\nthe kings and princes. We haven't asked our guest yet if he wants to\\ngo. We're going to the theatre; would you like to go with us?\\\"\\n\\nWalter was charmed at the prospect. He had never been in a theatre,\\nbut had long wanted to see such a play as Leentje had described. He\\ncared nothing for kings. He would have given a dozen kings for one\\nbaron carrying away a girl in the approved manner. The Glorioso\\ninfluence was still on him.\\n\\n\\\"We shall see half of the sovereigns of Europe,\\\" said Holsma, \\\"and\\na dozen candidates----\\\"\\n\\nWalter wondered what the candidates would do in the \\\"comedy.\\\" Sietske\\nexplained.\\n\\nThere was still plenty of time. Holsma was going out to see a patient\\nand promised to stop at Juffrouw Pieterse's.\\n\\nFor reasons of fashion and feminine finery the play was not to begin\\ntill nine o'clock.\\n\\nWalter heard that Femke, too, was to witness the performance; and from\\nthe conversation he gathered that the relations existing between the\\naristocratic family and the poor wash-girl were most cordial. Mevrouw\\nHolsma sent Sietske to ask Femke to come in; but Femke preferred to\\nremain with little Erich, with whom she was playing at the time.\\n\\n\\\"Erich?\\\" thought Walter.\\n\\n\\\"I thought as much,\\\" said Mevrouw Holsma. \\\"That's why she wasn't at\\nthe table. She would rather stay with the baby.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She says, too, that we sit at the table too long for her,\\\" added\\nSietske.\\n\\n\\\"She wouldn't enjoy the play anyway,\\\" observed William. \\\"She's a good\\ngirl, but she's a little thick-headed. Don't you think so, mamma?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Everyone must act according to his own convictions, and consult his\\nown tastes. Femke is too good to be forced to anything.\\\"\\n\\nThere must have been some special reason why the mother was going\\nto the theatre with the rest, when she preferred to stay at home\\nwith little Erich, who had the measles. But she was going to remain\\n\\\"only a little while,\\\" and then come back with Uncle Sybrand. He\\nwould return to the theatre taking Femke with him, if she cared to go.\\n\\n\\\"I call it thick-headedness,\\\" affirmed William. \\\"She just don't want\\nto put on a fine dress.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, she doesn't want to be a fine lady,\\\" said the mother. \\\"She is\\nvery sensible and fears that this might disturb her relations with her\\nmother. We ought to have taken her when she was little; but Mrs. Claus\\ncouldn't give her up then. And now Femke can't give herself up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's only stubborn,\\\" William explained.\\n\\n\\\"She is proud,\\\" corrected his mother, \\\"too proud to appear other than\\nshe is. She wouldn't exchange places with a princess.\\\"\\n\\nUncle Sybrand came. He announced that the \\\"Scylla\\\" of Rotgans was to be\\ngiven, followed by \\\"Chloris,\\\" with something else as a close. Holsma\\nhad already returned, bringing Walter the assurance that it was all\\nright with his mother.\\n\\nWalter was enchanted in anticipation. Was he still thinking of Femke?\\n\\nWilliam said: \\\"So far as I'm concerned she can stay at home. Suppose\\nthe students were to see me with a peasant girl! What would they do\\nfor me when I enter college in September?\\\"\\n\\nSuch an Amsterdamer calls everybody a \\\"peasant,\\\" even if he is a\\nstudent and able to explain what sort of a \\\"Scylla\\\" that was.\\n\\nAll were now dressed and starting. Walter was to see his first\\n\\\"comedy,\\\" and, perhaps, take a part in one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\n\\n\\nGood Muse, sweet Muse, take us back to Pieterseville again. Whisper\\nto me and tell me what happened there during Walter's romantic\\nenchantment; and have a care that my language rises to the dignity\\nof the subject.\\n\\nWe know already, Clio, how the mistress of the castle saw her progeny\\ndepart to protect the distressed lady from the nefarious attacks of\\nrobbers and murderers; how her blessing and the consecrated blade were\\nwithheld, and how the brave youth sallied forth with a nightcap his\\nonly weapon. We know, too, how the bachelor Stoffel, the hereditary\\ncustodian of the reputation of the family----\\n\\nAh, let us treat the matter quite simply, and leave the muse alone.\\n\\nOn the Friday evening in question Juffrouw Pieterse went to bed as\\nusual. The others did the same. There were no indications of bad\\ndreams. There was no trace of anxiety over the terrible danger to\\nwhich Walter had thoughtlessly exposed himself. This might have\\nbeen because they did not know of the danger. It had not been at\\nall necessary for Juffrouw Laps to conceal her intention so slyly\\nand always omit Walter's name from the knighthood of the Pieterse\\nfamily. Thanks to the stupidity of the family, she might have gained\\nher point without any finesse.\\n\\nSaturday morning dawned, that morning on which Mrs. Claus applied\\nthe restoratives so abundantly, and so efficaciously.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder where in the world the boy can be so long?\\\" said the mother.\\n\\n\\\"I don't suppose he got up very early; and then maybe she had him to\\nread a chapter out of the Bible at breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nThis explanation by Stoffel quieted the family for half an hour.\\n\\n\\\"How would it do for you to go over there?\\\" Juffrouw Pieterse proposed\\nat last.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not going, mother. You know it isn't on my way to school.\\\"\\n\\nThat was a sufficient reason. Never do anything that isn't on your\\nway--one of the favorite maxims of conservatism. Stoffel himself did\\nnot know how profound was the wisdom of his political aphorism.\\n\\n\\\"How would it do, then, to send Leentje over to Juffrouw Laps's to\\ninquire about Walter?\\\"\\n\\nThis proposal met with approval, and Leentje was dispatched forthwith.\\n\\nOh, poor Juffrouw Laps! She was \\\"the most wretched woman in the world;\\\"\\nand the room from which Walter had fled so suddenly was now the temple\\nof all the heterogeneous griefs and pains that novelists ever make\\nuse of.\\n\\nI will not place Walter above Joseph, Theseus, Jason or Hippolytos. May\\nApollo preserve me from such blind partiality. Not by any means do I\\nregard my hero as the most interesting mortal that ever left a woman\\nin the lurch. No, not in Walter's worth do I seek for the measure\\nof the forsaken lady's despair. Indeed, Juffrouw Laps's pain was\\nnot caused by any reflections as to the beauty or excellence of the\\nvanished knight. There was another element in the matter that was\\nfilling her with horror and driving her to distraction. With all due\\nrespect for the suffering of other abandoned ladies, Asnath, Ariadne,\\nMedea, Phaedra--but Juffrouw Laps had to face Walter's family. That\\nwas the trouble.\\n\\nHer fertile brain evolved the most wonderful plans. How would it do for\\nher to tell that he had been carried away in a fiery chariot before\\nthe eyes of the people, like Elias of old? She discarded the idea,\\nfor fear that no one would believe it.\\n\\nAt first she had waited at the window, watching for her little Theseus\\nto return. When she saw him no more she thought that perhaps the mob\\nhad carried him off with them. That was not an unpleasant thought;\\nsince her fear for his return to his family was greater than her\\ndesire for his return to her. This is easily understood: what might\\nhe not tell at home?\\n\\nIt was already daylight; but Juffrouw Laps knew that it was too early\\nto go to the Pieterses'. Besides, what would she say? That her little\\nknight had run away during the night? And why? Whither? How did she\\nknow but that he had already told the story in all its details?\\n\\nShe determined--not to determine upon anything, and to leave the\\nmatter with the \\\"Master\\\" for the present. With this pious resolve she\\nclimbed into her maidenly bed; and, before falling asleep, she groaned:\\n\\\"If the rascal had only broken his neck, like the high priest Eli,\\nin First Samuel, 4!\\\"\\n\\nNo doubt the Master saw the distress of his faithful disciple and\\ntaught her how to meet the situation that awaited her waking; for\\nLeentje soon returned with the assurance of Juffrouw Laps that Walter\\nwas out taking a morning walk.\\n\\nIn a way, this was the truth. The Juffrouw merely neglected to add\\nwhy he was taking a walk, and at what hour in the morning he had gone\\nout. Leentje, suspecting nothing, asked no questions. For her it was a\\n\\\"matter of course\\\" that he would not go out in the middle of the night.\\n\\nThe family now regarded the incident as fresh evidence of Walter's\\nobjectionable habit of roving, and nothing more. They felt no anxiety\\nfor his personal safety.\\n\\n\\\"There it is again!\\\" said the mother. \\\"The trouble and vexation I\\nhave with that boy. Anybody else would sit down for a while after\\nbreakfast; but he--what does he do? He runs away before it's hardly\\ndaylight. Is that any way to do, Stoffel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And to leave us here anxious and worrying over him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is a nice caper he's cutting again. He knows very well that\\nwe're all uneasy and won't have a minute's peace till he comes. God\\nonly knows where he is.\\\"\\n\\nStoffel could not wait to hear more. It was time for him to go\\nto school.\\n\\nIt may be repeated that there was not a word of truth in all this\\nuneasiness and anxiety. The family considered such a display to be the\\nproper thing; though, for the rest, they did not manifest the slightest\\ninterest in Walter's fate. For aught they knew some accident might\\nhave happened to the boy; but, instead of making a serious effort to\\nfind out what had become of him, his mother found it easier to accuse\\nhim of indecorous conduct and general worthlessness.\\n\\nThus matters remained until Dr. Holsma's carriage drove up before\\nJuffrouw Pieterse's door that afternoon and Kaatje alighted with her\\nmessage. After the recent fright Walter had given her, she was glad\\nenough to escape from such close proximity to the young lunatic. For\\nthus she regarded him.\\n\\nAll rushed to the window.\\n\\n\\\"There he is; there he is!\\\" cried the whole family in a breath, and\\nas loud as they could. \\\"Did you ever! Really, he's sitting there in\\nDr. Holsma's carriage.\\\"\\n\\nThis flattering observation banished everything else from their\\nthoughts, and made Kaatje's task an easy one. It was now a simple\\nmatter for her to allay their fears. They were no longer concerned\\nto know where Walter had been. It was enough that he was now in\\nDr. Holsma's carriage.\\n\\n\\\"Ate breakfast at the doctor's? Girl, you don't say so! And--and--why\\nisn't the coachman wearing his furs?\\\"\\n\\nKaatje was dumbfounded and could only stammer some reference to the\\nseason. In fact, the manner in which her message was being received\\nstrengthened her worst suspicions of Walter's sanity. It seemed to\\nher that the entire family was a little \\\"off.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And he really ate breakfast at the doctor's? Do you understand,\\nTrudie? Ate breakfast at Dr. Holsma's!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he ate breakfast with us. To be sure he did. The doctor himself\\nsaid so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At Dr. Holsma's, and ate breakfast there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, certainly. Where else?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And did he use the good manners I've taught him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Juffrouw! But----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And is he now in the carriage with the doctor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, Juffrouw--naturally!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen, my dear,\\\" continued the proud mother, \\\"I am going to tell you\\nsomething; but you need not repeat it to anybody else. Don't you know,\\nthat's an unusual child!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" sighed Kaatje, thoroughly convinced, \\\"I know it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know it, don't you? And do you know why? I'm going to tell\\nyou. He's an unusual child, because--Pietro, move away a little, and\\nyou, too, Mina. Trudie, you can stay where you are, but pay attention\\nto your knitting!--he's an unusual child, don't you know, because,\\nbefore he was born, you understand----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Juffrouw!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my dear, I dreamed of a butterfly; and it was dragging off an\\nelephant! You understand now?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, Juffrouw. I understand exactly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see? That's the reason. Give the doctor my politest regards,\\nand thank him for me. If he's only well-behaved--I mean Walter. And\\nthe coachman wears such a fur cap only in the winter?\\\"\\n\\nKaatje managed to escape, fully resolved never to dream of elephants\\nand butterflies. Such an indulgence seemed to her to be particularly\\ndangerous; for she now began to think in all seriousness that the\\nwhole family was crazy, and that what she had seen in Walter was\\nmerely a sample of the general disorder.\\n\\nWhen a few hours later the doctor himself stopped at Juffrouw\\nPieterse's, her joy over Walter's exaltation know no bounds. Holsma\\ntook note of the stupid woman's foibles and follies, and resolved\\nto prescribe an intellectual diet for Walter that would counteract\\ntheir influence.\\n\\nPoor Juffrouw Laps! If she had only known how happily everything\\nhad turned out, how much worry she might have spared herself! In the\\nseclusion of her own room she was still quoting the Bible and fighting\\nfor her honor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\n\\nThe reader is now invited to return to the theatre party, from which\\nhe was called suddenly away by the anxiety experienced in certain\\nquarters over Walter's disappearance.\\n\\nThe family took their seats, in the parquet this time, having had to\\ngive up their box to visiting potentates. The box was still unoccupied.\\n\\n\\\"A comedy!\\\" Walter thought. He looked about him and listened.\\n\\nThe house was crowded, and everyone was talking. Backstairs gossip and\\ncourt scandals were passed around. People were wondering who would\\nsit there, and who would sit there. Later arrivals were pushing at\\none another and quarreling about seats.\\n\\n\\\"The programs for the princes are printed on silk. What do you suppose\\nit cost a yard?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Rotgans is one of the first poets!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hm! Better say one of the second.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He's a poet of the seventh class.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, then, one of his plays? We have poets whose song is as clear\\nas a bell!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Bilderdyk! A Phoenix!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, these foreigners don't understand a word of it anyway, and it\\ndoesn't make any difference what the play is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's a pity about Floris.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, there's something behind that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Bilderdyk is a patriot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A genuine Hollander!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A genuine----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will give those foreigners something to think about.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sh!---- ... not much flattery. No Hollander is going to do that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sh!\\\"\\n\\nEverybody stood up. A footman appeared in the royal box, probably to\\nsee whether the cushions were straight on the chairs, or not.\\n\\n\\\"The idea, the very idea of standing up before a lackey!\\\"\\n\\nIt was enough to make them indignant; but they had done it, even\\nthose who protested loudest. There were city aldermen in the number,\\nand doctors, and professors, and prominent business men, including,\\nperhaps, the great Kopperlith.\\n\\nAnother period of babbling and waiting; then another footman\\nappeared. Again everybody sprang to his feet. Again all, except the\\nsilent Holsmas, railed at such stupidity.\\n\\nThe crowd became more restless. Innumerable times were they fooled by\\nsome footman or other, who opened a door to break the monotony. The\\npeople were already beginning to complain, but softly, cautiously.\\n\\nWalter was carried away with the elegance and magnificence of it\\nall. One thing, however, jarred upon his sense of propriety: he\\nwondered how such swell folk could say such commonplace things. The\\nHolsmas said nothing. Only once, when Uncle Sybrand pointed to a\\ncertain box, did they join in the general hubbub.\\n\\n\\\"She will sit there, I think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall be sorry if I have left little Erich all for nothing,\\\"\\nsaid Mevrouw Holsma.\\n\\n\\\"He's safe with Femke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but I had rather be with him myself. The child is sick. I'm\\nnot going to wait much longer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's doubtful whether she will come with the others. I've heard that\\nshe's full of moods and mischief. She cares nothing for convention. It\\nseems to run in the blood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If she isn't here by ten o'clock I'm going. I don't care much about\\nit, anyway.\\\"\\n\\nThis conversation occupied Walter for a short time. Who was this person\\non whose account Mevrouw Holsma had left the bedside of her sick child?\\n\\nThe tension of expectancy was broken, and a momentary excitement pulsed\\nthrough the multitude. All arose to their feet, and remained standing.\\n\\nAn emperor, or something of the kind, entered the royal box. Walter\\ncould see little; but he inferred what was going on from whisperings\\nhe heard about him. His majesty had made a quick rush for his chair,\\nturning over a few other chairs in so doing. That was a habit of\\nhis. Then he looked about the auditorium for a moment with squinted\\neyes, jerked up his chair and fell into it. He was in a hurry. The\\npublic was now at liberty to take their seats.\\n\\nThe other boxes were now filled quickly, as if by a stroke of\\nmagic. Remarkable costumes were on exhibition. There were bodices three\\ninches wide, with skirts of as many yards. Voluptuous bosoms hovered\\nbetween chin and girdle. Scanty sleevelets did not know whether they\\nwere to cover arms or shoulders. The ladies wore kid gloves reaching to\\ntheir armpits, and on their heads were turbans and flower-gardens. The\\nuniforms of the gentlemen were even more conspicuous. Those shakos! The\\nenemy would have run at the sight of them.\\n\\nThe orchestra began to play. It was that song about the brave Dunois,\\nof course.\\n\\n\\\"Arise!\\\" someone called; and all scrambled to their feet again in\\nhonor of the brave hero.\\n\\nThe curtain went up.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Yes, Minos, on the present that I gave to thee----\\n    'Twas stolen from the church----\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"What church?\\\" asked Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Sh!\\\" from William. \\\"Poetic license. You will see how it is.\\\"\\n\\n\\n    \\\"----hangs Nisus' crown and life.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Qu'est-ze qu'elle changte?\\\" cried the countess-palatine. Then she\\nlet herself out on costumes, speaking in a noisy voice.\\n\\nWalter listened like a finch. Not that he understood very well;\\nbut everything strange interested him intensely.\\n\\nNot a soul was touched by the tragic bravery of King Minos; no one was\\nlistening. Poor Rotgans! Afterwards it was said that Napoleon had been\\nespecially pleased with \\\"our Snoel\\\" and with \\\"our Watlier.\\\" Goodness,\\nNapoleon! When he was to be crowned he had Talma the mimic to drill\\nhim for the ceremony--instead of saying to Talma: \\\"Look, this is the\\nway an emperor appears when he's crowned!\\\"\\n\\nWalter listened attentively; even though he sometimes felt that he\\ncould make such verses himself.\\n\\nDuring the performance another commotion arose. One of their majesties\\nhad asked for a glass of orange lemonade; and this was something the\\nbuffetier did not have. A runner was dispatched to the drug-store\\npost haste. He returned with a bottle of lemon-syrup. The situation\\nbecame threatening. The news spread like fire that they were making a\\n\\\"Majesty\\\" wait for such a trifle. King Minos declared:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Feelings of pleasure thrill my inner man--\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"De l'eau de fleur d'orange! que diantre!\\\" cried a chamberlain. And\\nMinos noticed that nobody was interested in what was going on in\\nhis interior.\\n\\nA confectioner up on \\\"Olympus\\\" allowed his light to flash out and\\ngave some valuable information; but the police had him by the collar\\nin a jiffy. He was to be dragged away and put in confinement for\\nthe present. The technical charge was, \\\"Making a demonstration for\\nthe House of Orange.\\\" At that time the House of Orange was in exile,\\nand Napoleon's brother was king of Holland.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Feelings of pleasure thrill my inner man--\\\"\\n\\n\\nrepeated Minos with gusto. The conductor of the orchestra seized his\\nbaton and was going to play, \\\"Hail to the Emperor.\\\" Many stood up in\\nreadiness to escape in case of danger.\\n\\nIn the meantime the prisoner was screaming as if he were possessed;\\nbut the two Italian police that Napoleon had brought with him could\\nnot understand a word.\\n\\nThe emperor himself had forgotten that he had called for orange water\\nand was now engrossed in a military map.\\n\\n\\\"Qu' a-t-il?\\\" he seemed to be asking the lady next to him.\\n\\nMinos had begun again and was once more repeating his assurance that\\n\\\"feelings of pleasure thrill----\\\"\\n\\nWalter noted that the grown-up members of the Holsma party did not\\npay the slightest attention to the play.\\n\\n\\\"If she doesn't come soon, I'm going,\\\" Mevrouw Holsma repeated.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps she's sitting further back in the emperor's box, where we\\ncan't see her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've heard that in Paris she never stays fifteen minutes in the same\\nplace. Maybe we shall find her somewhere else,\\\" remarked another.\\n\\n\\\"I am not going to wait but five minutes longer. My little Erich is\\nworth more to me than a thousand cousins----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of the king,\\\" added Holsma.\\n\\nWalter had thought that they meant Femke. What, then, could be so\\ninteresting about the princess? The boxes were full of them.\\n\\nAt the close of the third act Mevrouw Holsma left with Uncle Sybrand,\\nwho was to return with Femke. \\\"If she will come,\\\" he said. \\\"For she\\ncares nothing for such a fuss.\\\"\\n\\nWalter knew better. Uncle Sybrand ought to have seen her in the\\n\\\"Juniper Berry.\\\" But a knight tells no tales.\\n\\nOld Minos is insanely in love with Ismene, who is so beautiful\\nand virtuous. Scylla is insanely in love with Minos, who is old and\\ndignified. Ismene is in love with Focus, who is a hero; and, possibly,\\nFocus loves Ismene, though he does not treat her quite gallantly. He\\nsays to her:\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Princess, thy reasons spare: to me they're odious!\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe tumult on Mount Olympus began afresh. Had the rebellious\\nconfectioner returned? All eyes were directed toward the gallery. A\\npoliceman in uniform was seen remonstrating in vain with some men\\non the front seat. In order to make them understand his French, or\\nItalian, he was pulling at their arms. They were to understand that\\nhe did not want to arrest them, or kill them, but merely wanted them\\nto give up their seats.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Princess, thy reasons spare: to me they're odious!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\\"Qu' y a-t-il encore?\\\" asked the emperor again; and, when one of the\\nchamberlains answered his question, he laughed heartily. Heads were\\ntogether everywhere. Something interesting was going forward on Mount\\nOlympus. People whispered and tittered and laughed outright. Their\\neyes were fastened on the gallery. Even the emperor stood up and\\nleaned out of his box. But it did no good: he could not see around\\nthe corner. He was surprised at this.\\n\\nThe countess-palatine, however, had got to the bottom of the\\nmatter. She was exchanging telegraphic messages with someone in the\\nbackground on Mount Olympus. No one was thinking of Rotgans' play.\\n\\nShe was greeting someone with that famous fan. Whom? The rebellious\\nconfectioner? With arms extended she was testifying that there was\\nsomething extraordinary up there among that rabble.\\n\\n\\n    \\\"Princess, thy reasons spare: to me they're odious!\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe countess-palatine threw off all restraint, and laughed and\\nlaughed. After the emperor had laughed hilarity was permissible. Her\\npleasure was beyond her control.\\n\\nI should have to have a double pen to report what Uncle Sybrand said\\non his return, and, at the same time, reproduce the exclamation that\\nescaped Walter, who was looking towards the gallery with eyes and\\nmouth wide open.\\n\\n\\\"Where is Femke?\\\" asked Holsma.\\n\\n\\\"She didn't want to come,\\\" replied Uncle Sybrand. \\\"Just as I said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There she is!\\\" cried Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Femke, M'neer, Femke, Femke--that is Femke! And she----\\\"\\n\\nThe girl above had taken hold of the policeman by the collar and,\\npushing him to one side, had pressed forward to the front row. There\\nshe had seated herself on the laps of the fellows the policeman had\\nbeen negotiating with in vain.\\n\\n\\\"It is Femke, M'neer. If only they don't hurt her!\\\"\\n\\nAgain the emperor stood up and stared at Mount Olympus. He saw the girl\\nwith the North Holland cap and nodded to her. The countess-palatine\\ngreeted again with her fan, as if she would congratulate her on\\nsecuring the seat.\\n\\n\\\"But, M'neer, it is Femke,\\\" cried Walter, amazed that he received\\nno answer.\\n\\nEven Holsma and Sybrand were surprised, but not so much so as Walter.\\n\\n\\\"Now, children,\\\" said Holsma, \\\"you can tell your mother that we saw\\nher.\\\" And to Walter he continued, \\\"That girl is a relation of ours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Femke!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, that isn't her name; and----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"M'neer, don't I know Femke?\\\"\\n\\nThat sounded quite different from what Walter had said that evening\\nwhen he \\\"denied\\\" her.\\n\\nThe girl's big blue eyes, roving about the hall, suddenly fell on\\nWalter. She bent over, looked him attentively in the face, then nodded\\nto him and threw him a kiss.\\n\\nAt least, he thought it was that way; and it was that way. But everyone\\nin the parquet thought that the kiss had been intended for him. Folk\\nof quality were annoyed at the insolence of the peasant wench; while\\nmore \\\"sporty\\\" persons returned the attention.\\n\\nSoon hissing was heard. The news had leaked out that Princess Erika,\\nthe cousin of the king, had dressed in the national costume to show\\nher affection for the people.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you believe it, M'neer? I tell you that is Femke,\\\" Walter\\nassured him with tears in his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"No, no, my boy. That girl is not Femke.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, she greeted me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You saw the emperor greet her; and you know he would not salute\\na wash-girl.\\\"\\n\\nThat was perhaps true; but it was hard for Walter to accept it. And,\\non the other hand, it was just as hard for him to believe that the\\nprincess was a cousin of the Holsmas.\\n\\nAgain he imagined that the girl was nodding to him and motioning her\\nlips. It looked to him as if she said: \\\"My brother!\\\" Walter lisped\\nthe words after her and pressed both hands to his breast.\\n\\nYes, now he had it! They considered him a little daft and wanted\\nto cure him of his fixed idea. That would explain the visit to the\\ntheatre and also Femke's alleged unwillingness to come with Uncle\\nSybrand. But--how did she dare to interfere with the policeman? And\\nthe greeting from the emperor? And how did Holsma know that he had\\n\\\"denied\\\" Femke, and that her presence could threaten his peace of mind?\\n\\n\\\"Oh, M'neer, let Femke sit here! I will be perfectly quiet. I am so\\nafraid she will get hurt up there among those men.\\\"\\n\\nHolsma looked at him wistfully. After all, could Kaatje have been\\nright about it? He sought to distract Walter's attention by referring\\nto other things; but it was useless.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Holsma at last \\\"I just wanted to tease you a\\nlittle. Femke is sitting up there, because she--doesn't wish to sit\\nhere. She thinks that it wouldn't be proper, because she's only a\\nwash-girl. She's afraid we would be ashamed. You see?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"M'neer, no one need be ashamed to sit by her. Not even the emperor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes,\\\" agreed Holsma. \\\"Quite so. Femke is a brave girl and\\ndoesn't need to cringe before anybody. Watch the play, my boy.\\\"\\n\\nWalter was willing to do what the doctor said, but not without taking\\nleave of that glorious apparition. He looked up; and she smiled to\\nhim again. Then she took from her breast a rose branch, with three\\nbuds on it, held it a moment between the forefinger and thumb of her\\nleft hand, pointed to Walter with her right and let it fall.\\n\\nThe rosebuds landed on the bald pate of a stout gentleman near the\\nHolsma party. He seized them and examined them admiringly; but, before\\nhe could decide what to do with them, Walter had sprung over half a\\ndozen chairs and deprived him of the precious property. With a glance\\ntoward Olympus, Walter pressed the roses to his lips. Princess Erika\\nnodded approval; and the playful countess-palatine applauded lustily.\\n\\nThat was more than Walter could bear. He had never forgiven himself\\nfor denying her; but she, the noble, the big-hearted, the majestic\\none!--she had proclaimed her pardon publicly before the people. And\\nthat was why she preferred to sit in the gallery. She had washed\\naway the black spots from his soul; she had restored his soiled\\nchivalry. These thoughts flashed through Walter's mind like lightning.\\n\\nHe sank to the floor in a faint. But was it any wonder?\\n\\nThe Holsmas took him home with them for the night; and another message\\nwas sent to Juffrouw Pieterse.\\n\\n\\\"Don't you see, Stoffel? Just as I said! I don't care if everybody\\nknows it. He's simply living at Dr. Holsma's. Trudie, don't forget when\\nLeentje goes to the grocer's---- Upon my soul, he's at Dr. Holsma's\\nall the time!\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\n\\n\\nThe next morning, Sunday, the doctor invited Walter into his study. He\\nspoke to him sympathetically and encouraged the boy to lay his case\\nbefore him; though he avoided everything that might make Walter believe\\nthat his experiences were anything extraordinary. He already knew\\nmore about it than Walter could tell. Even Walter's adventure with\\nJuffrouw Laps was perfectly transparent to him. There was nothing\\nlost to him because of the boy's lack of skill in handling the story.\\n\\nWhile Walter poured out to him his inner experiences, Holsma listened\\nquietly, as if it was all familiar to him. Walter's reverence and\\npassion for the good he interpreted as a commonplace phenomenon\\nincident to budding youth. He treated the boy's love for Femke as an\\nordinary matter. He admitted that it had been exactly the same way\\nwith him when he was a boy--a method that few parents and educators\\nseem to be familiar with.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly, certainly, my boy. In such moods a fellow would like\\nto be everywhere at the same time, ruling, regulating and putting\\nthings into order. He feels that he's responsible for everything;\\nand it hurts him to see so much crookedness in the world. I know very\\nwell how it is. But you must consider the means and remedies at your\\ndisposal. How are you going to begin to improve things?\\\"\\n\\nWalter was silent.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think that everyone is bad? I suppose you hardly think\\nthat. There are plenty of people in the world who wish for the same\\nthings that you are worrying about. Why don't they change the world?\\\"\\n\\nAgain Walter was silent. The very simplicity with which Holsma put\\nthe question disconcerted him.\\n\\n\\\"I will try to help you out. Do you believe that I am a good man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes!\\\" cried Walter enthusiastically.\\n\\n\\\"You think so? Well, I think so too. I should be ashamed not to be\\nable to say that. Why don't I reform the world? You often speak of\\nAfrica. That's because you don't know that country, my boy. And I, who\\nam a good man, have not abolished slavery. Why not, do you suppose?\\\"\\n\\nWalter returned no answer. Holsma was busy with a surgical\\noperation. Is it any wonder that the patient tried to withdraw the\\nmember that was being cut away?\\n\\n\\\"I will present the matter to you differently. Do you hear that\\nknocking and hammering? Listen! That comes from the blacksmith's shop\\nover there. It isn't so bad on Sunday; but you can easily imagine\\nthat the noise sometimes disturbs me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In case of sickness!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, and also when I wish to think. And then I should like to see the\\nblacksmiths swept away--quick--just like that! But why don't I do it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because--because you can't, M'neer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quite right. For the same reason I have not yet corrected any of the\\nwrongs in Africa. Nor in Asia; nor in America; nor in other countries\\nthat I might mention. But yesterday evening, when you were taken sick\\nin the theatre, I brought you home with me and put you to bed. Then\\nI sent a messenger to quiet your mother. That was my duty, wasn't it?\\n\\n\\\"No thanks, my boy. It seemed to me to be my duty; and I did\\nit--because I could. Whatever is impossible, is not my duty; and\\nthat's the reason I don't take those blacksmiths between my thumb\\nand forefinger and transport them to some other clime. For the same\\nreason I don't fret over doings in Africa. Impossible duty is no duty;\\nand running after the impossible interferes with the performance of\\nreal duties. At school did you ever fail to know a lesson?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, very often! But not lately; because Femke----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Leave Femke out of account for the present. I may say something\\nabout her another time. When you were neglecting your books at school,\\nyou were thinking of other things, things far removed from your work.\\n\\n\\\"That is a mistake that many young people make--don't be offended:\\nI did the same thing--and usually on account of laziness. It is more\\nconvenient to imagine one's self soaring over the distant mountain\\ntop than to lift a foot and step over the stone just in front of\\none. Of all the million things that you would like to do there are\\nonly a very few that you can do. Busy yourself with these few. That\\nis the way to succeed. Whatever comes up, always ask: 'What is my\\nimmediate duty?' Will you promise to do this?\\\"\\n\\nWalter gave Holsma his hand on it.\\n\\n\\\"And you would like to know more, my boy? I would, too. What lies\\nbefore you? Well, you are behind in your studies. Other boys of your\\nage know more. We will speak of that again, however; for that is\\nsomething to be attended to later, and does not come under the head of\\nimmediate duty. That smattering of Latin, for which you envy William,\\nyou can acquire in a few months, when once you've learned how to use\\nyour will. The enemies you have to fight now are quite different from\\nthe knights of your romances. Do not underestimate the difficulties\\nyou will have to contend with. That might result in your defeat. You\\nmust learn to use your intellectual faculties at will; and keep a firm\\ngrip on 'Fancy,' or else she will throw you head over heels. Dreaming\\nis not living.\\\"\\n\\nWalter nodded assent.\\n\\n\\\"True manliness,\\\" Holsma continued, \\\"means, to do what has to be done,\\nno difference how insignificant it may be. What would you think of a\\nlot of knights, who let tramps beat them over the heads because their\\ncode of honor did not allow them to fight with tramps? You are going\\ninto business now: come to me in a month and tell me if you have kept\\nyour word. Then we will speak further; but--that first! Will you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly I shall keep my word, M'neer. But, M'neer, may I ask----?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About Femke? Well, that is a good, brave girl. She's a cousin\\nof mine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But how did she happen to be----?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The young lady in the theatre wasn't Femke. That was Princess\\nErika. We wanted to see her because her ancestors were related to\\nours. You rogue, you! There was nothing special about that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A real princess?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; and Femke is a real wash-girl. I hope that Princess Erika has as\\nadmirable a character as Femke. But don't attribute too much importance\\nto this, my boy. Such differences in related families are of frequent\\noccurrence, whether one notices them, or not. There was a time when\\nErika's forefathers dressed themselves in skins; and mine did the\\nsame. We don't know whether she is aware that she has relations here\\nor not. Uncle Sybrand found out--well, he takes a sort of pleasure\\nin tracing out the identity of opposites. Rightly understood, the\\nworld is smaller than you imagine; everything is a link in the same\\nsequence. Who knows but that you may turn the course of history\\nto-morrow, when you go to work for--what is the style of the firm?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ouwetyd & Kopperlith.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, when you go to work for Ouwetyd & Kopperlith. But, whether it's\\nto be an historical event, or not, perform your immediate duty. That\\nis the chivalrous, manly thing for you to do--if you will take my\\nadvice. Will you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, M'neer! But--Femke?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There you go again! She has nothing to do with your immediate\\nduty. The lady that you must attend upon and serve faithfully is--who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean 'Business'?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Right. If you are determined to know more about Femke, I will tell\\nyou what she says. She says that for the present you must think of\\nnothing but your work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I will, I will!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For about ten years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ten years? Ten?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that is what she said when she heard how little you know and\\nhow little you can do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ten years?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that is what she said. Perhaps eight, perhaps twelve, perhaps\\ntwenty. One cannot say exactly beforehand. You understand that,\\ndon't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ten years!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So she said.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good. It will give me pleasure--and Femke, too. Don't imagine it\\nwill be particularly difficult. Ten years ago thousands began just\\nwhere you will begin to-morrow; and they are still alive. So, you see,\\nit can be done. Besides, think only of the first month; and then the\\ntime will seem shorter. I shall expect you to come to see me in about\\na month; then we shall have more to say.\\\"\\n\\nBefore Walter left, he promised again to banish all boyish follies\\nfrom his thoughts. But he put away the rosebuds; and he kept them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Walter Pieterse, by Multatuli\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"genres\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7771,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'romance', 'literary-fiction', 'feminism', 'classics', 'novels', 'literature', 'fiction', 'historical-fiction', '20th-century', 'adult-fiction', 'adult', 'school', 'unfinished', 'historical'}\",\n          \"{'adventure', 'middle-grade', 'literary-fiction', 'picture-books', 'animals', 'classics', 'fantasy', 'fiction', 'short-stories', 'historical-fiction', 'childrens', 'young-adult', 'speculative-fiction', 'american'}\",\n          \"{'classics', 'historical-romance', 'fiction', 'historical-fiction', '20th-century', 'adult', 'college'}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
